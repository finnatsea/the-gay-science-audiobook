00:00:09 - 00:00:12
The Teachers of the Purpose of Existence
00:00:12 - 00:00:16
Whether I contemplate men with benevolence or with an evil eye,
00:00:16 - 00:00:19
I always find them concerned with a single task,
00:00:19 - 00:00:22
all of them and every one of them in particular,
00:00:22 - 00:00:26
to do what is good for the preservation of the human race,
00:00:26 - 00:00:28
not from any feeling of love for the race,
00:00:28 - 00:00:32
but merely because nothing in them is older, stronger,
00:00:32 - 00:00:35
more inexorable and unconquerable than this instinct,
00:00:35 - 00:00:39
because this instinct constitutes the essence of our species,
00:00:39 - 00:00:41
our herd.
00:00:41 - 00:00:43
It is easy enough to divide our neighbors quickly,
00:00:43 - 00:00:47
with the usual myopia, from a mere five paces away,
00:00:47 - 00:00:50
into useful and harmful good and evil men.
00:00:50 - 00:00:52
But in any large-scale accounting,
00:00:52 - 00:00:55
when we reflect on the whole a little longer,
00:00:55 - 00:00:57
we become suspicious of this neat division,
00:00:57 - 00:01:00
and finally abandon it.
00:01:00 - 00:01:03
Even the most harmful man may really be the most useful
00:01:03 - 00:01:06
when it comes to the preservation of the species,
00:01:06 - 00:01:09
for he nurtures either in himself or in others,
00:01:09 - 00:01:10
through his effects,
00:01:10 - 00:01:15
instincts without which humanity would long have become feeble or rotten.
00:01:15 - 00:01:19
Hatred, the mischievous delight in the misfortunes of others,
00:01:19 - 00:01:21
the lust to rob and dominate,
00:01:21 - 00:01:23
and whatever else is called evil,
00:01:23 - 00:01:28
belongs to the most amazing economy of the preservation of the species.
00:01:28 - 00:01:32
To be sure, this economy is not afraid of high prices, of squandering,
00:01:32 - 00:01:35
and it is on the whole extremely foolish.
00:01:35 - 00:01:39
Still it is proven that it has preserved our race so far.
00:01:39 - 00:01:43
I no longer know whether you, my dear fellow man and neighbor,
00:01:43 - 00:01:47
are at all capable of living in a way that would damage the species.
00:01:47 - 00:01:50
In other words, unreasonably and badly.
00:01:50 - 00:01:54
What might have harmed the species may have become extinct,
00:01:54 - 00:01:55
many thousands of years ago,
00:01:55 - 00:01:59
and may by now be one of those things that are not possible,
00:01:59 - 00:02:00
even for God.
00:02:00 - 00:02:03
Pursue your best or your worst desires,
00:02:03 - 00:02:05
and above all perish.
00:02:05 - 00:02:10
In both cases you are probably still in some way a promoter and benefactor of humanity,
00:02:10 - 00:02:13
and therefore entitled to your eulogists,
00:02:13 - 00:02:15
but also to your detractors.
00:02:15 - 00:02:19
But you will never find anyone who could wholly mock you as an individual.
00:02:19 - 00:02:21
Also in your best qualities,
00:02:21 - 00:02:28
bringing home to you to the limits of truth your boundless, fly-like, frog-like wretchedness.
00:02:28 - 00:02:33
To laugh at oneself as one would have to laugh in order to laugh out of the whole truth,
00:02:33 - 00:02:38
to do that even the best so far lacked sufficient sense for the truth,
00:02:38 - 00:02:41
and the most gifted had too little genius for that.
00:02:41 - 00:02:44
Even laughter may yet have a future.
00:02:44 - 00:02:49
I mean, when the proposition, the species is everything, one is always none,
00:02:49 - 00:02:51
has become part of humanity,
00:02:51 - 00:02:57
and this ultimate liberation and irresponsibility has become accessible to all at all times.
00:02:57 - 00:03:01
Perhaps laughter will then have formed an alliance with wisdom.
00:03:01 - 00:03:05
Perhaps only gay science will then be left.
00:03:05 - 00:03:08
For the present, things are still quite different.
00:03:08 - 00:03:14
For the present, the comedy of existence has not yet become conscious of itself.
00:03:14 - 00:03:17
For the present, we still live in the age of tragedy,
00:03:17 - 00:03:20
the age of moralities and religions.
00:03:20 - 00:03:25
What is the meaning of the ever-new appearance of these founders of moralities and religions,
00:03:25 - 00:03:28
these instigators of fights over moral valuations,
00:03:28 - 00:03:31
these teachers of remorse and religious wars?
00:03:31 - 00:03:34
What is the meaning of these heroes on this stage?
00:03:34 - 00:03:38
Thus far, these have been the heroes, and everything else,
00:03:38 - 00:03:43
even if at times it was all that could be seen and was much too near to us,
00:03:43 - 00:03:46
has always merely served to set the stage for these heroes.
00:03:46 - 00:03:52
Whether it was machinery or coulisse, or took the form of confidants and valets,
00:03:52 - 00:03:56
the poets, for example, were always the valets of some morality.
00:03:56 - 00:04:01
It is obvious that these tragedians too promote the interests of the species,
00:04:01 - 00:04:04
even if they should believe that they promote the interest of God,
00:04:04 - 00:04:06
or work as God's emissaries.
00:04:06 - 00:04:12
They too promote the life of the species by promoting the faith in life.
00:04:12 - 00:04:15
Life is worth living, every one of them shouts.
00:04:15 - 00:04:17
There is something to life.
00:04:17 - 00:04:20
There is something behind life, beneath it.
00:04:20 - 00:04:21
Beware.
00:04:21 - 00:04:27
From time to time this instinct, which is at work equally in the highest and the basest men,
00:04:27 - 00:04:30
the instinct for the preservation of the species,
00:04:30 - 00:04:33
erupts as reason and as passion of the spirit.
00:04:33 - 00:04:39
Then it is surrounded by a resplendent retinue of reasons and tries with all the force at its command
00:04:39 - 00:04:45
to make us forget that at bottom it is instinct, drive, folly, lack of reasons.
00:04:45 - 00:04:48
Life shall be loved, because...
00:04:48 - 00:04:52
Man shall advance himself and his neighbor because...
00:04:52 - 00:04:57
What names all these shalls and becauses receive and may yet receive in the future?
00:04:57 - 00:05:03
In order that what happens necessarily and always, spontaneously and without any purpose,
00:05:03 - 00:05:05
may henceforth appear to be done for some purpose,
00:05:05 - 00:05:09
and strike man as rational and an ultimate commandment.
00:05:09 - 00:05:14
The ethical teacher comes on stage as the teacher of the purpose of existence.
00:05:14 - 00:05:18
And to this end he invents a second, different existence,
00:05:18 - 00:05:24
and unhinges by means of his new mechanics the old, ordinary existence.
00:05:24 - 00:05:32
Indeed, he wants to make sure that we do not laugh at existence, or at ourselves, or at him.
00:05:32 - 00:05:37
For him, one is always one, something first and last and tremendous.
00:05:37 - 00:05:41
For him, there are no species, sums, or zeros.
00:05:41 - 00:05:46
His inventions and valuations may be utterly foolish and overenthusiastic.
00:05:46 - 00:05:51
He may badly misjudge the course of nature and deny its conditions.
00:05:51 - 00:05:55
And all ethical systems hitherto have been so foolish and anti-natural
00:05:55 - 00:06:01
that humanity would have perished of every one of them if it had gained power over humanity.
00:06:01 - 00:06:06
And yet, whenever the hero appeared on the stage, something new was attained.
00:06:06 - 00:06:12
The gruesome counterpart of laughter, that profound emotional shock felt by many individuals,
00:06:12 - 00:06:14
at the thought,
00:06:14 - 00:06:17
Yes, I am worthy of living.
00:06:17 - 00:06:24
Life and I, and you, and all of us, became interesting to ourselves once again for a little while.
00:06:24 - 00:06:29
There is no denying that in the long run every one of these great teachers of a purpose
00:06:29 - 00:06:33
was vanquished by laughter, reason, and nature.
00:06:33 - 00:06:38
The short tragedy always gave way again and returned into the eternal comedy of existence.
00:06:38 - 00:06:43
And, the waves of uncountable laughter, to cite Aeschylus,
00:06:43 - 00:06:47
must in the end overwhelm even the greatest of these tragedians.
00:06:47 - 00:06:51
In spite of all this laughter which makes the required corrections,
00:06:51 - 00:06:56
human nature has nevertheless been changed by the ever new appearance of these teachers
00:06:56 - 00:06:59
of the purpose of existence.
00:06:59 - 00:07:01
It now has one additional need,
00:07:01 - 00:07:07
the need for the ever new appearance of such teachers and teachings of a purpose.
00:07:07 - 00:07:14
Gradually, man has become a fantastic animal that has to fulfill one more condition of existence than any other animal.
00:07:14 - 00:07:20
Man has to believe, to know, from time to time, why he exists.
00:07:20 - 00:07:23
His race cannot flourish without a periodic trust in life,
00:07:23 - 00:07:26
without faith in reason in life,
00:07:26 - 00:07:30
and again and again the human race will decree from time to time,
00:07:30 - 00:07:34
there is something at which it is absolutely forbidden henceforth to laugh.
00:07:34 - 00:07:37
The most cautious friend of man will add,
00:07:37 - 00:07:42
not only laughter and gay wisdom, but the tragic too, with all its sublime unreason,
00:07:42 - 00:07:47
belongs among the means and necessities of the preservation of the species.
00:07:47 - 00:07:48
Consequently,
00:07:48 - 00:07:50
consequently,
00:07:50 - 00:07:52
consequently,
00:07:52 - 00:07:54
oh, do you understand me, my brothers?
00:07:54 - 00:07:57
Do you understand this new law of ebb and flood?
00:07:57 - 00:08:01
There is a time for us too.
00:08:01 - 00:08:03
Two.
00:08:03 - 00:08:06
The intellectual conscience.
00:08:06 - 00:08:10
I keep having the same experience and keep resisting it every time.
00:08:10 - 00:08:13
I do not want to believe it, although it is palpable.
00:08:13 - 00:08:17
The great majority of people lacks an intellectual conscience.
00:08:17 - 00:08:22
Indeed, it has often seemed to me as if anyone calling for an intellectual conscience
00:08:22 - 00:08:27
were as lonely in the most densely populated cities as if he were in a desert.
00:08:27 - 00:08:31
Everybody looks at you with strange eyes and goes right on handling his scales,
00:08:31 - 00:08:33
calling this good
00:08:33 - 00:08:35
and that evil.
00:08:35 - 00:08:38
Nobody even blushes when you intimate that their weights are underweight,
00:08:38 - 00:08:41
nor do people feel outraged.
00:08:41 - 00:08:43
They merely laugh at your doubts.
00:08:43 - 00:08:44
I mean,
00:08:44 - 00:08:48
the great majority of people does not consider it contemptible to believe this
00:08:48 - 00:08:50
or that and to live accordingly
00:08:50 - 00:08:53
without first having given themselves an account of the final and most certain
00:08:53 - 00:08:55
reasons pro and con,
00:08:55 - 00:08:59
and without even troubling themselves about such reasons afterward.
00:08:59 - 00:09:01
The most gifted men
00:09:01 - 00:09:05
and the noblest women still belong to this great majority.
00:09:05 - 00:09:07
But what is good-heartedness,
00:09:07 - 00:09:09
refinement, or genius to me
00:09:09 - 00:09:14
when the person who has these virtues tolerates slack feelings in his faith and judgments
00:09:14 - 00:09:17
and when he does not account the desire for certainty
00:09:17 - 00:09:20
as his inmost craving and deepest distress,
00:09:20 - 00:09:25
as that which separates the higher human beings from the lower?
00:09:25 - 00:09:28
Among some pious people I found a hatred of reason
00:09:28 - 00:09:30
and was well disposed to them for that,
00:09:30 - 00:09:34
for this at least betrayed their bad intellectual conscience.
00:09:34 - 00:09:38
But to stand in the midst of this rerum concordia discourse
00:09:38 - 00:09:43
and of this whole marvelous uncertainty and rich ambiguity of existence,
00:09:43 - 00:09:44
without questioning,
00:09:44 - 00:09:49
without trembling with the craving and the rapture of such questioning,
00:09:49 - 00:09:51
without at least hating the person who questions,
00:09:51 - 00:09:54
perhaps even finding him faintly amusing,
00:09:54 - 00:09:56
that is what I feel to be contemptible,
00:09:56 - 00:10:00
and this is the feeling for which I look first in everybody.
00:10:00 - 00:10:04
Some folly keeps persuading me that every human being has this feeling,
00:10:04 - 00:10:06
simply because he is human.
00:10:06 - 00:10:09
This is my type of injustice.
00:10:09 - 00:10:11
3.
00:10:11 - 00:10:14
Noble and Common
00:10:14 - 00:10:18
Common natures consider all noble, magnanimous feelings inexpedient
00:10:18 - 00:10:21
and therefore, first of all, incredible.
00:10:21 - 00:10:26
They blink when they hear of such things and seem to feel like saying,
00:10:26 - 00:10:28
surely there must be some advantage involved,
00:10:28 - 00:10:31
one cannot see through everything.
00:10:31 - 00:10:33
They are suspicious of the noble person,
00:10:33 - 00:10:37
as if he surreptitiously sought his advantage.
00:10:37 - 00:10:42
When they are irresistibly persuaded of the absence of selfish intentions and gains,
00:10:42 - 00:10:45
they see the noble person as a kind of fool.
00:10:45 - 00:10:50
They despise him in his joy and laugh at his shining eyes.
00:10:50 - 00:10:52
How can one enjoy being at a disadvantage?
00:10:52 - 00:10:57
How could one desire with one's eyes open to be disadvantaged?
00:10:57 - 00:11:01
Some disease of reason must be associated with the noble affection.
00:11:01 - 00:11:03
Thus they think and sneer,
00:11:03 - 00:11:08
as they sneer at the pleasure that a madman derives from his fixed idea.
00:11:08 - 00:11:10
What distinguishes the common type
00:11:10 - 00:11:13
is that it never loses sight of its advantage
00:11:13 - 00:11:18
and that this thought of purpose and advantage is even stronger than the strongest instincts.
00:11:18 - 00:11:23
Not to allow these instincts to lead one astray to perform inexpedient acts,
00:11:23 - 00:11:26
that is their wisdom and pride.
00:11:26 - 00:11:29
Compared to them, the higher type is more unreasonable
00:11:29 - 00:11:32
for those who are noble, magnanimous and self-sacrificial,
00:11:32 - 00:11:34
do succumb to their instincts,
00:11:34 - 00:11:38
and when they are at their best, their reason pauses.
00:11:38 - 00:11:42
An animal that protects its young at the risk of its life,
00:11:42 - 00:11:46
or that during the mating period follows the female even into death,
00:11:46 - 00:11:48
does not think of danger and death.
00:11:48 - 00:11:50
Its reason also pauses,
00:11:50 - 00:11:54
because the pleasure in its young, or in the female,
00:11:54 - 00:11:57
and the fear of being deprived of this pleasure dominate it totally.
00:11:57 - 00:12:00
The animal becomes more stupid than usual,
00:12:00 - 00:12:03
just like those who are noble and magnanimous.
00:12:03 - 00:12:07
They have some feelings of pleasure and displeasure that are so strong
00:12:07 - 00:12:10
that they reduce the intellect to silence or to servitude.
00:12:10 - 00:12:13
At that point their heart displaces the head,
00:12:13 - 00:12:16
and one speaks of passion.
00:12:16 - 00:12:19
Now and then we also encounter the opposite,
00:12:19 - 00:12:22
and as it were the reversal of passion.
00:12:22 - 00:12:25
For example, somebody once laid his hand on Fontenelle's heart,
00:12:25 - 00:12:26
saying to him,
00:12:26 - 00:12:30
What you have there, dear sir, is another brain.
00:12:30 - 00:12:33
The unreason, or counter-reason of passion,
00:12:33 - 00:12:36
is what the common type despises in the noble,
00:12:36 - 00:12:39
especially when this passion is directed toward objects
00:12:39 - 00:12:43
whose value seems quite fantastic and arbitrary.
00:12:43 - 00:12:46
One is annoyed with those who succumb to the passion of the belly,
00:12:46 - 00:12:51
but at least one comprehends the attraction that plays the tyrant in such cases.
00:12:51 - 00:12:55
But one cannot comprehend how anyone could risk his health and honor
00:12:55 - 00:12:58
for the sake of a passion for knowledge.
00:12:58 - 00:13:01
The taste of the higher type is for exceptions,
00:13:01 - 00:13:05
for things that leave most people cold and seem to lack sweetness.
00:13:05 - 00:13:08
The higher type has a singular value standard.
00:13:08 - 00:13:12
Moreover, it usually believes that the idiosyncrasy of its taste
00:13:12 - 00:13:15
is not a singular value standard.
00:13:15 - 00:13:20
Rather, it posits its values and disvalues as generally valid,
00:13:20 - 00:13:23
and thus becomes incomprehensible and impractical.
00:13:23 - 00:13:27
Very rarely does a higher nature retain sufficient reason
00:13:27 - 00:13:30
for understanding and treating everyday people as such.
00:13:30 - 00:13:35
For the most part, this type assumes that its own passion is present,
00:13:35 - 00:13:37
but kept concealed in all men,
00:13:37 - 00:13:41
and this belief even becomes an ardent and eloquent faith.
00:13:41 - 00:13:45
But when such exceptional people do not see themselves as the exception,
00:13:45 - 00:13:48
how can they ever understand the common type
00:13:48 - 00:13:51
and arrive at a fair evaluation of the rule?
00:13:51 - 00:13:53
Thus they too speak of the folly,
00:13:53 - 00:13:56
inexpediency, and fantasies of humanity,
00:13:56 - 00:14:00
stunned that the course of the world should be so insane,
00:14:00 - 00:14:03
and puzzled that it won't own up to what is needful.
00:14:03 - 00:14:08
This is the eternal injustice of those who are noble.
00:14:08 - 00:14:14
4. What preserves the species?
00:14:14 - 00:14:19
The strongest and most evil spirits have so far done the most to advance humanity.
00:14:19 - 00:14:23
Again and again they relumed the passions that were going to sleep.
00:14:23 - 00:14:26
All ordered society puts the passions to sleep,
00:14:26 - 00:14:30
and they reawakened again and again the sense of comparison,
00:14:30 - 00:14:36
of contradiction, of the pleasure in what is new, daring, untried.
00:14:36 - 00:14:41
They compelled men to pit opinion against opinion, model against model,
00:14:41 - 00:14:45
usually by force of arms, by toppling boundary markers,
00:14:45 - 00:14:50
by violating pieties, but also by means of new religions and moralities.
00:14:50 - 00:14:53
In every teacher and preacher of what is new,
00:14:53 - 00:14:57
we encounter the same wickedness that makes conquerors notorious,
00:14:57 - 00:15:00
even if its expression is subtler
00:15:00 - 00:15:02
and it does not immediately set the muscles in motion,
00:15:03 - 00:15:07
and therefore also does not make one that notorious.
00:15:07 - 00:15:10
What is new, however, is always evil,
00:15:10 - 00:15:14
being that which wants to conquer and overthrow the old boundary markers
00:15:14 - 00:15:20
and the old pieties, and only what is old is good.
00:15:20 - 00:15:23
The good men are in all ages those who dig the old thoughts,
00:15:23 - 00:15:28
digging deep and getting them to bear fruit, the farmers of the spirit.
00:15:28 - 00:15:31
But eventually all land is exploited,
00:15:31 - 00:15:35
and the ploughshare of evil must come again and again.
00:15:35 - 00:15:38
Nowadays there is a profoundly erroneous moral doctrine
00:15:38 - 00:15:40
that is celebrated especially in England.
00:15:40 - 00:15:44
This holds that judgments of good and evil
00:15:44 - 00:15:48
sum up experiences of what is expedient and inexpedient.
00:15:48 - 00:15:52
One holds that what is called good preserves the species,
00:15:52 - 00:15:55
while what is called evil harms the species.
00:15:55 - 00:15:58
In truth, however, the evil instincts are expedient,
00:15:58 - 00:16:02
species-preserving, and indispensable to as high a degree as the good ones.
00:16:02 - 00:16:06
Their function is merely different.
00:16:06 - 00:16:11
5. Unconditional Duties
00:16:11 - 00:16:15
All those who feel they need the strongest words and sounds,
00:16:15 - 00:16:19
the most eloquent gestures and postures, in order to be effective at all,
00:16:19 - 00:16:23
such as revolutionary politicians, socialists,
00:16:23 - 00:16:26
preachers of repentance with or without Christianity,
00:16:26 - 00:16:30
all of whom cannot tolerate semi-successes, talk of duties,
00:16:30 - 00:16:34
and actually always of duties that are supposed to be unconditional.
00:16:34 - 00:16:38
Without that, they would lack the justification for their great pathos,
00:16:38 - 00:16:41
and they understand this very well.
00:16:41 - 00:16:46
Thus they reach for moral philosophies that preach some categorical imperative,
00:16:46 - 00:16:51
or they ingest a goodly piece of religion, as Mazzini did, for example.
00:16:51 - 00:16:54
Because they desire the unconditional confidence of others,
00:16:54 - 00:16:58
they need first of all to develop unconditional self-confidence
00:16:58 - 00:17:01
on the basis of some ultimate and indisputable commandment
00:17:01 - 00:17:03
that is inherently sublime,
00:17:03 - 00:17:08
and they want to feel like, and be accepted as, its servants and instruments.
00:17:08 - 00:17:12
Here we have the most natural and usually very influential opponents
00:17:12 - 00:17:15
of moral enlightenment and skepticism.
00:17:15 - 00:17:17
But they are rare.
00:17:17 - 00:17:20
Yet a very comprehensive class of such opponents is to be found
00:17:20 - 00:17:23
wherever self-interest requires submission,
00:17:23 - 00:17:27
while reputation and honor seem to prohibit submission.
00:17:27 - 00:17:31
Whoever feels that his dignity is incompatible with the thought
00:17:31 - 00:17:34
of being the instrument of a prince, or a party, or sect,
00:17:34 - 00:17:37
or even worse, of a financial power,
00:17:37 - 00:17:41
say, because he is, after all, the descendant of an old and proud family,
00:17:41 - 00:17:44
but who nevertheless wants to, or must be,
00:17:44 - 00:17:47
such an instrument before himself and before the public,
00:17:47 - 00:17:51
requires pompous principles that can be mouthed at any time,
00:17:51 - 00:17:54
principles of some unconditional obligation
00:17:54 - 00:17:57
to which one may submit without shame.
00:17:57 - 00:18:00
Refined servility clings to the categorical imperative
00:18:00 - 00:18:03
and is the mortal enemy of those who wish to deprive duty
00:18:03 - 00:18:06
of its unconditional character.
00:18:06 - 00:18:10
That is what decency demands of them, and not only decency.
00:18:10 - 00:18:14
6. Chaturah.
00:18:14 - 00:18:16
Loss of dignity.
00:18:16 - 00:18:19
Reflecting has lost all the dignity of its form.
00:18:19 - 00:18:23
The ceremony and solemn gestures of reflecting have become ridiculous,
00:18:23 - 00:18:27
and an old steely-whisked man would be considered intolerable.
00:18:27 - 00:18:31
We think too fast, even while walking or on the way,
00:18:31 - 00:18:35
or while engaged in other things, no matter how serious the subject.
00:18:35 - 00:18:39
We require little preparation, not even much silence.
00:18:39 - 00:18:42
It is as if we carried in our heads an unstoppable machine
00:18:42 - 00:18:46
that keeps working even under the most unfavorable circumstances.
00:18:46 - 00:18:51
Formerly, one could tell simply by looking at a person that he wanted to think
00:18:51 - 00:18:53
– it was probably a rare occurrence –
00:18:53 - 00:18:58
that he now wished to become wiser and prepared himself for a thought.
00:18:58 - 00:19:02
He set his face as for prayer and stopped walking.
00:19:02 - 00:19:05
Yes, one even stood still for hours in the middle of the road
00:19:05 - 00:19:09
when the thought arrived, on one leg or two legs.
00:19:09 - 00:19:13
That seemed to be required by the dignity of the matter.
00:19:14 - 00:19:19
7. Something for the industrious.
00:19:19 - 00:19:22
Anyone who now wishes to make a study of moral matters
00:19:22 - 00:19:26
opens up for himself an immense field for work.
00:19:26 - 00:19:30
All kinds of individual passions have to be thought through and pursued through –
00:19:30 - 00:19:35
different ages, peoples, and great and small individuals.
00:19:35 - 00:19:39
All their reason and all their evaluations and perspectives on things
00:19:39 - 00:19:42
have to be brought into the light.
00:19:42 - 00:19:47
So far, all that has given color to existence still lacks a history.
00:19:47 - 00:19:52
Where could you find a history of love, of avarice, of envy, of conscience,
00:19:52 - 00:19:56
of pious respect for tradition, or of cruelty?
00:19:56 - 00:20:00
Even a comparative history of law, or at least of punishment,
00:20:00 - 00:20:03
is so far lacking completely.
00:20:03 - 00:20:07
Has anyone made a study of different ways of dividing up the day
00:20:08 - 00:20:13
or of the consequences of a regular schedule of work, festivals, and rest?
00:20:13 - 00:20:16
What is known of the moral effects of different foods?
00:20:16 - 00:20:19
Is there any philosophy of nutrition?
00:20:19 - 00:20:23
The constant revival of noisy agitation for and against vegetarianism
00:20:23 - 00:20:26
proves that there is no such philosophy.
00:20:26 - 00:20:30
Has anyone collected men's experiences of living together?
00:20:30 - 00:20:32
In monasteries, for example?
00:20:32 - 00:20:35
Has the dialectic of marriage and friendship ever been explicated?
00:20:35 - 00:20:40
Have the manners of scholars, of businessmen, artists, or artisans
00:20:40 - 00:20:42
been studied and thought about?
00:20:42 - 00:20:44
There is so much in them to think about.
00:20:44 - 00:20:48
Whatever men have so far viewed as the conditions of their existence
00:20:48 - 00:20:53
and all the reason, passion, and superstition involved in such a view,
00:20:53 - 00:20:56
has this been researched exhaustively?
00:20:56 - 00:21:00
The most industrious people will find that it involves too much work
00:21:00 - 00:21:03
simply to observe how differently men's instincts have grown
00:21:03 - 00:21:07
and might yet grow depending on different moral climates.
00:21:07 - 00:21:11
It would require whole generations and generations of scholars
00:21:11 - 00:21:15
who would collaborate systematically to exhaust the points of view
00:21:15 - 00:21:17
and the material.
00:21:17 - 00:21:20
The same applies to the demonstration of the reasons
00:21:20 - 00:21:22
for the differences between moral climates.
00:21:22 - 00:21:26
Why is it that the sun of one fundamental moral judgment
00:21:26 - 00:21:30
and main standard of value shines here and another one there?
00:21:31 - 00:21:34
And it would be yet another job to determine the erroneousness
00:21:34 - 00:21:38
of all these reasons and the whole nature of moral judgments to date.
00:21:38 - 00:21:42
If all these jobs were done, the most insidious question of all
00:21:42 - 00:21:44
would emerge into the foreground,
00:21:44 - 00:21:47
whether science can furnish goals of action
00:21:47 - 00:21:50
after it has proved that it can take action.
00:21:50 - 00:21:55
such goals away and annihilate them, and then experimentation would be in order that would
00:21:55 - 00:22:01
allow every kind of heroism to find satisfaction, centuries of experimentation that might eclipse
00:22:01 - 00:22:05
all the great projects and sacrifices of history to date.
00:22:05 - 00:22:11
So far, science has not yet built its cyclopic buildings, but the time for that, too, will
00:22:11 - 00:22:13
come.
00:22:13 - 00:22:16
8.
00:22:16 - 00:22:21
Conscious Virtues All the human qualities of which we are conscious,
00:22:21 - 00:22:26
and especially those whose visibility and obviousness for others, too, we take for granted,
00:22:26 - 00:22:30
are subject to altogether different laws of development than are those qualities which
00:22:30 - 00:22:36
we know either badly or not at all, and which also conceal themselves by means of their
00:22:36 - 00:22:42
subtlety, even from very subtle observers, knowing how to hide, as it were, behind nothing
00:22:42 - 00:22:44
at all.
00:22:44 - 00:22:48
It is similar with the subtle sculptures on the scales of reptiles.
00:22:48 - 00:22:53
It would be wrong to take them for ornaments or weapons, for they become visible only under
00:22:53 - 00:22:58
a microscope, under an artificially sharpened eye that similar animals for which these little
00:22:58 - 00:23:03
sculptures might signify ornaments or weapons simply lack.
00:23:03 - 00:23:08
Our visible moral qualities, and especially those we believe to be visible, follow their
00:23:08 - 00:23:13
own course, and the invisible ones that have the same names but are in relation to other
00:23:13 - 00:23:15
men.
00:23:15 - 00:23:20
Neither ornaments nor weapons also follow their own course, probably a wholly different
00:23:20 - 00:23:25
course, and they probably have lines, subtleties, and sculptures that might give pleasure to
00:23:25 - 00:23:28
a god with a divine microscope.
00:23:28 - 00:23:33
Thus we have, for example, our industry, our ambition, our acuteness.
00:23:33 - 00:23:35
All the world knows about that.
00:23:35 - 00:23:42
But in addition to all that, we probably also have our industry, our ambition, our acuteness.
00:23:42 - 00:23:47
But for these reptile scales, no microscope has been invented as yet.
00:23:47 - 00:23:52
At this point the friends of instinctive morality will say, bravo, at least he considers unconscious
00:23:52 - 00:23:55
virtues possible, and that suffices us.
00:23:55 - 00:23:59
Oh, you are satisfied with so little.
00:23:59 - 00:24:02
9.
00:24:02 - 00:24:07
Our Eruptions Countless things that humanity acquired in
00:24:07 - 00:24:12
earlier stages, but so feebly and embryonically that nobody could perceive this acquisition,
00:24:12 - 00:24:17
suddenly emerge into the light much later, perhaps after centuries, meanwhile they have
00:24:17 - 00:24:19
become strong and ripe.
00:24:19 - 00:24:25
Some ages seem to lack altogether some talent or some virtue, as certain individuals do
00:24:25 - 00:24:26
too.
00:24:26 - 00:24:31
But just wait for their children and grandchildren, if you have time to wait that long.
00:24:31 - 00:24:35
They bring to light what was hidden in their grandfathers, and what their grandfathers
00:24:35 - 00:24:38
themselves did not suspect.
00:24:38 - 00:24:42
Often the son already betrays his father, and the father understands himself better
00:24:42 - 00:24:44
after he has a son.
00:24:44 - 00:24:50
All of us harbor concealed gardens and plantings, and to use another metaphor, we are, all of
00:24:50 - 00:24:55
us, growing volcanoes that approach the hour of their eruption, but how near or distant
00:24:55 - 00:25:00
that is, nobody knows, not even God.
00:25:00 - 00:25:02
10.
00:25:02 - 00:25:05
A Kind of Atavism
00:25:05 - 00:25:09
I prefer to understand the rare human beings of an age as suddenly emerging late ghosts
00:25:09 - 00:25:15
of past cultures and their powers, as atavisms of a people and its mores, that way one really
00:25:15 - 00:25:17
can understand a little about them.
00:25:17 - 00:25:21
Now they seem strange, rare, extraordinary.
00:25:21 - 00:25:27
And whoever feels these powers in himself must nurse, defend, honor, and cultivate them
00:25:27 - 00:25:32
against another world that resists them, until he becomes either a great human being or a
00:25:32 - 00:25:36
mad and eccentric one, or perishes early.
00:25:36 - 00:25:42
Formerly these same qualities were common and therefore considered common, not distinguished.
00:25:42 - 00:25:45
Perhaps they were demanded or presupposed.
00:25:45 - 00:25:49
In any case, it was impossible to become great through them, if only because they involved
00:25:49 - 00:25:52
no danger of madness or solitude.
00:25:52 - 00:25:57
It is preeminently in the generations and castes that conserve a people that we encounter
00:25:57 - 00:26:04
such recrudescences of old instincts, while such atavisms are improbable wherever races,
00:26:04 - 00:26:07
habits, and valuations change too rapidly.
00:26:07 - 00:26:13
For tempo is as significant for the development of peoples as it is in music.
00:26:13 - 00:26:19
In our case, an andante of development is altogether necessary as the andante of a passionate
00:26:19 - 00:26:26
and slow spirit, and that is after all the value of the spirit of conservative generations.
00:26:26 - 00:26:27
11.
00:26:29 - 00:26:31
Consciousness.
00:26:31 - 00:26:36
Consciousness is the last and latest development of the organic, and hence also what is most
00:26:36 - 00:26:39
unfinished and unstrong.
00:26:39 - 00:26:43
Consciousness gives rise to countless errors that lead an animal or man to perish sooner
00:26:43 - 00:26:48
than necessary, exceeding destiny, as Homer puts it.
00:26:48 - 00:26:53
If the conserving association of the instincts were not so very much more powerful, and if
00:26:53 - 00:26:59
it did not serve on the whole as a regulator, humanity would have to perish of its misjudgments
00:26:59 - 00:27:04
and its fantasies with open eyes, of its lack of thoroughness and its credulity.
00:27:04 - 00:27:07
In short, of its consciousness.
00:27:07 - 00:27:11
Rather without the former, humanity would long have disappeared.
00:27:11 - 00:27:17
Before a function is fully developed and mature, it constitutes a danger for the organism,
00:27:17 - 00:27:21
and it is good if during the interval it is subjected to some tyranny.
00:27:21 - 00:27:25
Thus consciousness is tyrannized, not least by our pride in it.
00:27:25 - 00:27:31
One thinks that it constitutes the kernel of man, what is abiding, eternal, ultimate,
00:27:31 - 00:27:33
and most original in him.
00:27:33 - 00:27:37
One takes consciousness for a determinate magnitude.
00:27:37 - 00:27:40
One denies its growth and its intermittences.
00:27:40 - 00:27:43
One takes it for the unity of the organism.
00:27:43 - 00:27:49
This ridiculous overestimation and misunderstanding of consciousness has the very useful consequence
00:27:49 - 00:27:54
that it prevents an all-too-fast development of consciousness.
00:27:54 - 00:27:58
Believing that they possess consciousness, men have not exerted themselves very much
00:27:58 - 00:28:03
to acquire it, and things haven't changed much in this respect.
00:28:03 - 00:28:08
To this day, the task of incorporating knowledge and making it instinctive is only beginning
00:28:08 - 00:28:13
to dawn on the human eye and is not yet clearly discernible.
00:28:13 - 00:28:18
It is a task that is seen only by those who have comprehended that so far we have incorporated
00:28:18 - 00:28:24
only our errors and that all our consciousness relates to errors.
00:28:24 - 00:28:27
Twelve
00:28:27 - 00:28:28
On the Aim of Science
00:28:28 - 00:28:31
What?
00:28:31 - 00:28:35
The aim of science should be to give men as much pleasure and as little displeasure as
00:28:35 - 00:28:37
possible.
00:28:37 - 00:28:41
But what if pleasure and displeasure were so tied together that whoever wanted to have
00:28:41 - 00:28:46
as much as possible of one must also have as much as possible of the other?
00:28:46 - 00:28:50
And whoever wanted to learn to jubilate up to the heavens would also have to be prepared
00:28:50 - 00:28:52
for depression unto death.
00:28:52 - 00:28:55
And that is how things may well be.
00:28:55 - 00:29:00
At least the Stoics believed that this was how things were, and they were consistent
00:29:00 - 00:29:05
when they also desired as little pleasure as possible in order to get as little displeasure
00:29:05 - 00:29:11
as possible out of life, when they kept saying the virtuous man is the happiest man.
00:29:11 - 00:29:17
This was both the school's eye-catching sign for the great mass and a casuistic subtlety
00:29:17 - 00:29:19
for the subtle.
00:29:19 - 00:29:21
To this day you have the choice.
00:29:21 - 00:29:27
Either as little displeasure as possible, painlessness in brief, and in the last analysis
00:29:27 - 00:29:31
socialists and politicians of all parties have no right to promise their people more
00:29:31 - 00:29:36
than that, or as much displeasure as possible as the price for the growth of an abundance
00:29:36 - 00:29:41
of subtle pleasures and joys that have rarely been relished yet.
00:29:41 - 00:29:46
If you decide for the former and desire to diminish and lower the level of human pain,
00:29:46 - 00:29:51
you also have to diminish and lower the level of their capacity for joy.
00:29:51 - 00:29:54
Actually science can promote either goal.
00:29:54 - 00:29:59
So far it may still be better known for its power of depriving man of his joys and making
00:29:59 - 00:30:03
him colder, more like a statue, more Stoic.
00:30:03 - 00:30:08
But it might yet be found to be the great dispenser of pain, and then its counterforce
00:30:08 - 00:30:10
might be found at the same time.
00:30:10 - 00:30:15
Its immense capacity for making new galaxies of joy flare up.
00:30:15 - 00:30:18
13.
00:30:18 - 00:30:23
On the doctrine of the feeling of power, benefiting and hurting others are ways of exercising
00:30:23 - 00:30:25
one's power upon others.
00:30:25 - 00:30:28
That is all one desires in such cases.
00:30:28 - 00:30:34
One hurts those whom one wants to feel one's power, for pain is a much more efficient means
00:30:34 - 00:30:36
to that end than pleasure.
00:30:36 - 00:30:41
Pain always raises the question about its origin, while pleasure is inclined to stop
00:30:41 - 00:30:43
with itself without looking back.
00:30:43 - 00:30:48
We benefit and show benevolence to those who are already dependent on us in some way, which
00:30:48 - 00:30:52
means that they are used to thinking of us as causes.
00:30:52 - 00:30:56
We want to increase their power because in that way we increase ours, or we want to show
00:30:56 - 00:31:00
them how advantageous it is to be in our power.
00:31:00 - 00:31:05
That way, they will become more satisfied with their condition and more hostile to and
00:31:05 - 00:31:09
willing to fight against the enemies of our power.
00:31:09 - 00:31:14
Whether benefiting or hurting others involves sacrifices for us does not affect the ultimate
00:31:14 - 00:31:16
value of our actions.
00:31:16 - 00:31:21
Even if we offer our lives, as martyrs do for their church, this is a sacrifice that
00:31:21 - 00:31:28
is offered for our desire for power, or for the purpose of preserving our feeling of power.
00:31:28 - 00:31:34
Those who feel I possess truth, how many possessions would they not abandon in order to save this
00:31:34 - 00:31:35
feeling?
00:31:35 - 00:31:41
What would they not throw overboard to stay on top, which means above the others who lack
00:31:41 - 00:31:43
the truth?
00:31:43 - 00:31:48
Certainly the state in which we hurt others is rarely as agreeable in an unadulterated
00:31:48 - 00:31:51
way as that in which we benefit others.
00:31:51 - 00:31:55
It is a sign that we are still lacking power, or it shows a sense of frustration in the
00:31:55 - 00:31:57
face of this poverty.
00:31:57 - 00:32:03
It is accompanied by new dangers and uncertainties for what power we do possess, and clouds our
00:32:03 - 00:32:09
horizon with the prospect of revenge, scorn, punishment, and failure.
00:32:09 - 00:32:15
It is only for the most irritable and covetous devotees of the feeling of power that it is
00:32:15 - 00:32:20
perhaps more pleasurable to imprint the seal of power on a recalcitrant brow.
00:32:20 - 00:32:25
Those for whom the sight of those who are already subjected, the objects of benevolence,
00:32:25 - 00:32:27
is a burden and boredom.
00:32:27 - 00:32:32
What is decisive is how one is accustomed to spice one's life.
00:32:32 - 00:32:37
It is a matter of taste whether one prefers the slow or the sudden, the assured or the
00:32:37 - 00:32:41
dangerous and audacious increase of power.
00:32:41 - 00:32:45
One seeks this or that spice depending on one's temperament.
00:32:45 - 00:32:48
An easy prey is something contemptible for proud natures.
00:32:48 - 00:32:53
They feel good only at the sight of unbroken men who might become their enemies, and at
00:32:53 - 00:32:57
the sight of all possessions that are hard to come by.
00:32:57 - 00:33:01
Against one who is suffering they are often hard because he is not worthy of their aspirations
00:33:01 - 00:33:07
and pride, but they are doubly obliging toward their peers whom it would be honorable to
00:33:07 - 00:33:11
fight if the occasion should ever arise.
00:33:11 - 00:33:16
Spurred by the good feeling of this perspective, the members of the knightly caste became accustomed
00:33:16 - 00:33:20
to treating each other with exquisite courtesy.
00:33:20 - 00:33:25
Pity is the most agreeable feeling among those who have little pride and no prospects of
00:33:25 - 00:33:27
great conquests.
00:33:27 - 00:33:32
For them, easy prey, and that is what all who suffer are, is enchanting.
00:33:32 - 00:33:36
Pity is praised as the virtue of prostitutes.
00:33:36 - 00:33:39
14.
00:33:39 - 00:33:46
The things people call love, avarice and love, what different feelings these two terms evoke.
00:33:46 - 00:33:51
Nevertheless, it could be the same instinct that has two names, once deprecated by those
00:33:51 - 00:33:56
who have in whom the instinct has calmed down to some extent, and who are afraid for
00:33:56 - 00:34:01
their possessions, and the other time seen from the point of view of those who are not
00:34:01 - 00:34:07
satisfied but still thirsty, and who therefore glorify the instinct as good.
00:34:07 - 00:34:12
Our love of our neighbor, is it not a lust for new possessions?
00:34:12 - 00:34:18
And likewise our love of knowledge of truth, and altogether any lust for what is new.
00:34:18 - 00:34:22
Eventually we become tired of the old, of what we safely possess, and we stretch out
00:34:22 - 00:34:25
our hands again.
00:34:25 - 00:34:28
Even the most beautiful scenery is no longer assured of our love after we have lived in
00:34:28 - 00:34:34
it for three months, and some more distant coast attracts our avarice.
00:34:34 - 00:34:37
Possessions are generally diminished by possession.
00:34:37 - 00:34:42
Our pleasure in ourselves tries to maintain itself by again and again changing something
00:34:42 - 00:34:44
new into ourselves.
00:34:44 - 00:34:46
That is what possession means.
00:34:46 - 00:34:50
To become tired of some possession means tiring of ourselves.
00:34:50 - 00:34:53
One can also suffer of an excess.
00:34:53 - 00:34:59
The lust to throw away or to distribute can also assume the honorary name of love.
00:34:59 - 00:35:05
When we see somebody suffer, we like to exploit this opportunity to take possession of him.
00:35:05 - 00:35:10
Those who become his benefactors and pity him, for example, do this, and call the lust
00:35:10 - 00:35:14
for a new possession that he awakens in them, love.
00:35:14 - 00:35:20
And the pleasure they feel is comparable to that aroused by the prospect of a new conquest.
00:35:20 - 00:35:24
Sexual love betrays itself most clearly as a lust for possession.
00:35:24 - 00:35:30
The lover desires unconditional and sole possession of the person for whom he longs.
00:35:30 - 00:35:35
He desires equally unconditional power over the soul and over the body of the beloved.
00:35:35 - 00:35:41
He alone wants to be loved and desires to live and rule in the other soul as supreme
00:35:41 - 00:35:43
and supremely desirable.
00:35:43 - 00:35:47
If one considers that this means nothing less than excluding the whole world from a
00:35:47 - 00:35:50
precious good, from happiness and enjoyment.
00:35:50 - 00:35:55
If one considers that the lover aims at the impoverishment and deprivation of all competitors
00:35:55 - 00:36:00
and would like to become the dragon guarding his golden horde as the most inconsiderate
00:36:00 - 00:36:05
and selfish of all conquerors and exploiters.
00:36:05 - 00:36:10
If one considers, finally, that to the lover himself the whole rest of the world appears
00:36:10 - 00:36:16
indifferent, pale, and worthless, and he is prepared to make any sacrifice, to disturb
00:36:16 - 00:36:23
any order, to subordinate all other interests, then one comes to feel genuine amazement that
00:36:23 - 00:36:29
this wild avarice and injustice of sexual love has been glorified and deified so much
00:36:29 - 00:36:31
in all ages.
00:36:31 - 00:36:37
Indeed that this love has furnished the concept of love as the opposite of egoism, while it
00:36:37 - 00:36:41
actually may be the most ingenuous expression of egoism.
00:36:41 - 00:36:47
At this point, linguistic usage has evidently been formed by those who did not possess,
00:36:47 - 00:36:49
but desired.
00:36:49 - 00:36:52
Probably there have always been too many of these.
00:36:52 - 00:36:56
Those to whom much possession and satiety were granted in this area have occasionally
00:36:56 - 00:37:03
made some casual remark about the raging demon, as that most gracious and beloved of all Athenians,
00:37:03 - 00:37:04
Sophocles did.
00:37:04 - 00:37:07
But Eros has always laughed at such blasphemers.
00:37:07 - 00:37:11
They were invariably his greatest favorites.
00:37:11 - 00:37:15
Here and there on earth we may encounter a kind of continuation of love in which this
00:37:15 - 00:37:21
possessive craving of two people for each other gives way to a new desire and lust for
00:37:21 - 00:37:25
possession, a shared higher thirst for an ideal above them.
00:37:25 - 00:37:26
But who knows such love?
00:37:26 - 00:37:28
Who has experienced it?
00:37:28 - 00:37:32
Its right name is friendship.
00:37:33 - 00:37:35
15.
00:37:35 - 00:37:37
From a Distance
00:37:37 - 00:37:43
This mountain makes the landscape it dominates charming and significant in every way.
00:37:43 - 00:37:48
Having said this to ourselves a hundred times, we become so unreasonable and grateful that
00:37:48 - 00:37:54
we suppose that whatever bestows so much charm must also be the most charming thing around,
00:37:54 - 00:37:57
and we climb the mountain and are disappointed.
00:37:57 - 00:38:03
Only the mountain itself and the whole landscape around us, below us, have lost their magic.
00:38:03 - 00:38:08
We had forgotten that some greatness, like some goodness, wants to be beheld only from
00:38:08 - 00:38:16
a distance, and by all means only from below, not from above, otherwise it makes no impression.
00:38:16 - 00:38:21
Perhaps you know some people near you who must look at themselves only from a distance
00:38:21 - 00:38:26
in order to find themselves at all tolerable or attractive and invigorating.
00:38:26 - 00:38:31
Self-knowledge is strictly inadvisable for them.
00:38:31 - 00:38:36
16.
00:38:36 - 00:38:38
Over the Footbridge
00:38:38 - 00:38:42
In our relations with people who are bashful about their feelings, we must be capable of
00:38:42 - 00:38:43
dissimulation.
00:38:43 - 00:38:48
They feel a sudden hatred against anyone who catches them in a tender, enthusiastic or
00:38:48 - 00:38:52
elevated feeling, as if he had seen their secrets.
00:38:52 - 00:38:56
If you want to make them feel good at such moments, you have to make them laugh or voice
00:38:56 - 00:38:59
some cold but witty sarcasm.
00:38:59 - 00:39:04
Then their feeling freezes and they regain power over themselves, but I am giving you
00:39:04 - 00:39:07
the moral before telling the story.
00:39:07 - 00:39:11
There was a time in our lives when we were so close that nothing seemed to obstruct our
00:39:11 - 00:39:16
friendship and brotherhood, and only a small footbridge separated us.
00:39:16 - 00:39:19
Just as you were about to step on it, I asked you,
00:39:19 - 00:39:23
Do you want to cross the footbridge to me?
00:39:23 - 00:39:29
Immediately you did not want to anymore, and when I asked you again, you remained silent.
00:39:29 - 00:39:33
Since then mountains and torrential rivers and whatever separates and alienates have
00:39:33 - 00:39:38
been cast between us, and even if we wanted to get together, we couldn't.
00:39:38 - 00:39:45
But when you now think of that little footbridge, words fail you and you sob and marvel.
00:39:45 - 00:39:48
17.
00:39:48 - 00:39:51
Finding Motives for Our Poverty
00:39:51 - 00:39:55
There is no trick that enables us to turn a poor virtue into a rich and overflowing
00:39:55 - 00:40:01
one, but we can reinterpret its poverty into a necessity so that it no longer offends us
00:40:01 - 00:40:05
when we see it, and we no longer sulk at fate on its account.
00:40:05 - 00:40:10
That is what a wise gardener does when he places the poor little stream in his garden
00:40:10 - 00:40:15
in the arms of a nymph and thus finds a motive for its poverty, and who does not need nymphs
00:40:15 - 00:40:17
as he does.
00:40:17 - 00:40:20
18.
00:40:20 - 00:40:23
The Pride of Classical Antiquity
00:40:23 - 00:40:27
We lack the classical coloring of nobility because our feelings no longer know the slaves
00:40:27 - 00:40:29
of classical antiquity.
00:40:29 - 00:40:35
A Greek of noble descent found such tremendous intermediary stages and such distance between
00:40:35 - 00:40:42
his own height and that ultimate baseness that he could scarcely see the slave clearly.
00:40:42 - 00:40:45
Even Plato could not really see him anymore.
00:40:45 - 00:40:50
It is different with us who are accustomed to the doctrine of human equality, though
00:40:50 - 00:40:52
not to equality itself.
00:40:52 - 00:40:58
One who is not at his own disposal and who lacks leisure does not by any means seem contemptible
00:40:58 - 00:41:00
to us for that reason.
00:41:00 - 00:41:04
Perhaps too much that is slavish in this sense sticks to each of us, in accordance with the
00:41:04 - 00:41:09
conditions of our social order and activities, which are utterly different from those of
00:41:09 - 00:41:11
the ancients.
00:41:11 - 00:41:16
The Greek philosophers went through life feeling secretly that there were far more slaves than
00:41:16 - 00:41:23
one might think, meaning that everybody who was not a philosopher was a slave.
00:41:23 - 00:41:27
Their pride overflowed at the thought that even the most powerful men on earth belonged
00:41:27 - 00:41:29
among their slaves.
00:41:29 - 00:41:33
This pride, too, is alien and impossible for us.
00:41:33 - 00:41:39
Not even metaphorically does the word slave possess its full power for us.
00:41:39 - 00:41:41
19.
00:41:41 - 00:41:43
Evil.
00:41:43 - 00:41:49
Examine the lives of the best and most fruitful people and peoples and ask yourselves whether
00:41:49 - 00:41:54
a tree that is supposed to grow to a proud height can dispense with bad weather and storms,
00:41:54 - 00:42:00
whether misfortune and external resistance, some kinds of hatred, jealousy, stubbornness,
00:42:00 - 00:42:07
mistrust, hardness, avarice, and violence do not belong among the favorable conditions
00:42:07 - 00:42:12
without which any great growth, even of virtue, is scarcely possible.
00:42:12 - 00:42:16
The poison of which weaker natures perish strengthens the strong.
00:42:16 - 00:42:19
Nor do they call it poison.
00:42:19 - 00:42:21
20.
00:42:21 - 00:42:23
The dignity of folly.
00:42:23 - 00:42:27
A few millennia further along on the road of the last century and everything men do
00:42:27 - 00:42:34
will exhibit the highest prudence, but that way prudence will lose all of its dignity.
00:42:34 - 00:42:39
By then it will be necessary to be prudent, but it will also be so common and vulgar that
00:42:39 - 00:42:44
a disgusted taste will experience this necessity as a vulgarity.
00:42:44 - 00:42:48
And just as a tyranny of truth and science could increase esteem for the lie, a tyranny
00:42:48 - 00:42:52
of prudence could spur the growth of a new kind of nobility.
00:42:52 - 00:42:56
To be noble might then come to mean to entertain follies.
00:42:56 - 00:42:59
21.
00:42:59 - 00:43:02
To the teachers of selfishness.
00:43:02 - 00:43:07
A man's virtues are called good depending on their probable consequences not for him
00:43:07 - 00:43:09
but for us and society.
00:43:09 - 00:43:16
The praise of virtues has always been far from selfless, far from unegoistic.
00:43:16 - 00:43:21
Otherwise one would have had to notice that virtues like industriousness, obedience, chastity,
00:43:21 - 00:43:27
filial piety, and justice are usually harmful for those who possess them, being instincts
00:43:27 - 00:43:33
that dominate them too violently and covetously and resist the efforts of reason to keep them
00:43:33 - 00:43:36
in balance with their other instincts.
00:43:36 - 00:43:39
When you have a virtue, a real, whole virtue, and not
00:43:39 - 00:43:46
merely a mini-instinct for some virtue. You are its victim. But your neighbor praises
00:43:46 - 00:43:52
your virtue precisely on that account. One praises the industrious even though they harm
00:43:52 - 00:43:58
their eyesight or the spontaneity and freshness of their spirit. One honors and feels sorry
00:43:58 - 00:44:03
for the youth who has worked himself into the ground because one thinks, for society
00:44:03 - 00:44:09
as a whole, the loss of even the best individual is merely a small sacrifice. Too bad that
00:44:09 - 00:44:15
such sacrifices are needed. But it would be far worse if the individual would think otherwise
00:44:15 - 00:44:20
and considered his preservation and development more important than his work in the service
00:44:20 - 00:44:27
of society. Thus one feels sorry for the youth not for his own sake but because a devoted
00:44:27 - 00:44:34
instrument, ruthless against itself, a so-called good man, has been lost to society by his
00:44:34 - 00:44:39
deeth. Perhaps one gives some thought to the question whether it would have been more useful
00:44:39 - 00:44:46
for society if he had been less ruthless against himself and had preserved himself longer.
00:44:46 - 00:44:50
One admits that there would have been some advantage in that, but one considers the other
00:44:50 - 00:44:55
advantage, that a sacrifice has been made and that the attitude of the sacrificial animal
00:44:55 - 00:45:02
has once again been confirmed for all to see, greater and of more lasting significance.
00:45:02 - 00:45:06
Thus what is really praised when virtues are praised is, first, their instrumental
00:45:06 - 00:45:12
nature and, secondly, the instinct in every virtue that refuses to be held in check by
00:45:12 - 00:45:18
the overall advantage for the individual himself, in sum, the unreason in virtue that leads
00:45:18 - 00:45:25
the individual to allow himself to be transformed into a mere function of the whole. The praise
00:45:25 - 00:45:30
of virtue is the praise of something that is privately harmful, the praise of instincts
00:45:30 - 00:45:35
that deprive a human being of his noblest selfishness and the strength for the highest
00:45:35 - 00:45:42
autonomy. To be sure, for educational purposes and to lead men to incorporate virtuous habits,
00:45:42 - 00:45:47
one emphasizes effects of virtue that make it appear as if virtue and private advantage
00:45:47 - 00:45:54
were sisters, and some such relationship actually exists. Blindly raging industriousness, for
00:45:54 - 00:46:00
example, this typical virtue of an instrument is represented as the way to wealth and honor
00:46:00 - 00:46:06
and as the poison that best cures boredom and the passions, but one keeps silent about
00:46:06 - 00:46:13
its dangers, its extreme dangerousness. That is how education always proceeds. One tries
00:46:13 - 00:46:19
to condition an individual by various attractions and advantages to adopt a way of thinking
00:46:19 - 00:46:25
and behaving that, once it has become a habit, instinct and passion, will dominate him to
00:46:25 - 00:46:31
his own ultimate disadvantage, but for the general good. How often I see that blindly
00:46:31 - 00:46:36
raging industriousness does create wealth and reap honors, while at the same time depriving
00:46:36 - 00:46:41
the organs of their subtlety, which alone would make possible the enjoyment of wealth
00:46:41 - 00:46:46
and honors. Also, that this chief antidote to boredom and the passions at the same time
00:46:46 - 00:46:52
blunts the senses and leads the spirit to resist new attractions. The most industrious
00:46:52 - 00:46:59
of all ages, ours, does not know how to make anything of all its industriousness and money,
00:46:59 - 00:47:04
except always still more money and still more industriousness, for it requires more genius
00:47:04 - 00:47:12
to spend than to acquire. Well, we shall have our grandchildren. If this education succeeds,
00:47:12 - 00:47:18
then every virtue of an individual is a public utility and a private disadvantage, measured
00:47:18 - 00:47:23
against the supreme private goal, probably some impoverishment of the spirit and the
00:47:23 - 00:47:30
senses, or even a premature decline. Consider from this point of view one by one the virtues
00:47:30 - 00:47:38
of obedience, chastity, filial piety, and justice. The praise of the selfless, the self-sacrificial,
00:47:38 - 00:47:43
the virtuous, that is, of those who do not apply their whole strength and reason to their
00:47:43 - 00:47:49
own preservation, development, elevation, promotion, and the expansion of their power,
00:47:49 - 00:47:55
but rather live, in relation to themselves, modestly and thoughtlessly, perhaps even with
00:47:55 - 00:48:01
indifference or irony. This praise certainly was not born from the spirit of selflessness.
00:48:01 - 00:48:07
The neighbor praises selflessness, because it brings him advantages. If the neighbor
00:48:07 - 00:48:12
himself were selfless in his thinking, he would repudiate this diminution of strength,
00:48:12 - 00:48:18
this mutilation for his benefit. He would work against the development of such inclinations.
00:48:18 - 00:48:24
And above all, he would manifest his selflessness by not calling it good. This indicates the
00:48:24 - 00:48:29
fundamental contradiction in the morality that is very prestigious nowadays. The motives
00:48:29 - 00:48:35
of this morality stand opposed to its principle. What this morality considers its proof is
00:48:35 - 00:48:43
refuted by its criterion of what is moral. In order not to contravene its own morality,
00:48:43 - 00:48:48
the demand, you shall renounce yourself and sacrifice yourself, could be laid down only
00:48:48 - 00:48:54
by those who thus renounced their own advantage and perhaps brought about their own destruction
00:48:54 - 00:49:00
through the demanded sacrifice of individuals. But as soon as the neighbor, or society, recommends
00:49:00 - 00:49:07
altruism for the sake of its utility, it applies the contradictory principle. You shall
00:49:07 - 00:49:12
seek your advantage even at the expense of everything else. And thus one preaches in
00:49:12 - 00:49:17
the same breath, A thou shalt, and thou shalt not.
00:49:17 - 00:49:21
XXII. L'Ordre du Jour pour le Roi.
00:49:21 - 00:49:26
The day begins. Let us begin to order for this day the business and the festivals of
00:49:26 - 00:49:32
our most merciful Master who is still deigning to rest. His Majesty has bad weather today.
00:49:32 - 00:49:37
We shall be careful not to call it bad. We shall not speak of the weather, but we shall
00:49:37 - 00:49:42
be a little more solemn about our business than would otherwise be necessary and a little
00:49:42 - 00:49:48
more festive about the festivals. Perhaps His Majesty will even be ill. At breakfast
00:49:48 - 00:49:53
we shall present the latest good news of the preceding evening, the arrival of M. Montaigne
00:49:53 - 00:49:59
who jokes so agreeably about his illness. He suffers from a stone. We shall receive
00:49:59 - 00:50:06
a few persons. Persons? What would that puffed-up old frog say? Who will be among them? If he
00:50:06 - 00:50:14
heard this word? I am not a person, he would say, but always the substance itself. And
00:50:14 - 00:50:19
this reception will take longer than anybody finds agreeable. That is reason enough to
00:50:19 - 00:50:25
tell of the poet who wrote on his door. Whoever enters here honors me, whoever does not pleases
00:50:25 - 00:50:32
me. What a courteous way of expressing a discourtesy! And perhaps this poet is altogether right
00:50:32 - 00:50:37
to be discourteous. It is said that his poems are better than the poet. Let him write many
00:50:37 - 00:50:43
more then and withdraw from the world as much as possible, which is, after all, the meaning
00:50:43 - 00:50:48
of his civil incivility. Conversely, a prince is always worth more than
00:50:48 - 00:50:55
his verse, even if—but what am I saying? We are chatting, and the whole court thinks
00:50:55 - 00:50:59
that we are already at work and racking our brains. There is no window in which anyone
00:50:59 - 00:51:06
ever sees a light burn before ours. Listen! Wasn't that the bell? Damn! The day and the
00:51:06 - 00:51:12
dance begin and we don't know the schedule. We have to improvise. All the world improvises
00:51:12 - 00:51:17
its day. Let us proceed today as all the world does.
00:51:17 - 00:51:23
At that, my strange morning dream vanished, probably a victim of the hard strokes of the
00:51:23 - 00:51:28
tower clock which announced the fifth hour with all of its accustomed gravity. It seems
00:51:28 - 00:51:33
to me that on this occasion the god of dreams was pleased to make fun of my habit of beginning
00:51:33 - 00:51:39
the day by ordering it and making it tolerable for myself. And it is possible that I have
00:51:39 - 00:51:44
sometimes done this too formally, as if I were a prince.
00:51:44 - 00:51:51
23. The Signs of Corruption. Consider the following signs of those states of society
00:51:51 - 00:51:57
which are necessary from time to time and which are designated with the word corruption.
00:51:57 - 00:52:03
As soon as corruption sets in anywhere, superstition becomes rank, and the previous common faith
00:52:03 - 00:52:08
of a people becomes pale and powerless against it. For superstition is second-order free
00:52:08 - 00:52:15
spirit. Those who surrender to it choose certain forms and formulas that they find congenial
00:52:15 - 00:52:21
and permit themselves some freedom of choice. Whoever is superstitious is always, compared
00:52:21 - 00:52:26
with the religious human being, much more of a person, and a superstitious society is
00:52:26 - 00:52:31
one in which there are many individuals and much delight in individuality.
00:52:31 - 00:52:36
From this perspective, superstition always appears as progress and as a sign that the
00:52:36 - 00:52:42
intellect is becoming more independent and demands its rights. Those who then complain
00:52:42 - 00:52:48
of corruption are the adherents of the old religion and religiosity, and they have also
00:52:48 - 00:52:54
determined linguistic usage hitherto and given superstition a bad reputation even among the
00:52:54 - 00:53:01
freest spirits. Let us realize that it is actually a symptom of enlightenment. Second,
00:53:01 - 00:53:06
a society in which corruption spreads is accused of exhaustion, and it is obvious that the
00:53:06 - 00:53:12
esteem for war and the pleasure in war diminish, while the comforts of life are now desired
00:53:12 - 00:53:18
just as ardently as warlike and athletic honors were formerly. But what is generally overlooked
00:53:18 - 00:53:23
is that the ancient national energy and national passion that became gloriously visible in
00:53:23 - 00:53:29
war and warlike games have now been transmuted into countless private passions and have merely
00:53:29 - 00:53:35
become less visible. Indeed, in times of corruption, the power and force of the national energies
00:53:35 - 00:53:41
that are expended are probably greater than ever, and the individual squanders them as
00:53:41 - 00:53:47
lavishly as he could not have formerly when he was simply not yet rich enough. Thus, it
00:53:47 - 00:53:53
is precisely in times of exhaustion that tragedy runs through houses and streets, that
00:53:53 - 00:53:58
great love and great hatred are born, and that the flame of knowledge flares up into
00:53:58 - 00:54:04
the sky. Third, it is usually said, as if one wanted to make up for the reproaches of
00:54:04 - 00:54:10
superstition and exhaustion, that such times of corruption are gentler and that cruelty
00:54:10 - 00:54:17
declines drastically compared with the older, stronger age that was more given to faith.
00:54:17 - 00:54:22
But this praise I cannot accept any more than those reproaches. All I concede is that
00:54:22 - 00:54:28
cruelty now becomes more raffined and that its older forms henceforth offend the new
00:54:28 - 00:54:35
taste. But the art of wounding and torturing others with words and looks reaches its supreme
00:54:35 - 00:54:40
development in times of corruption. It is only now that malice and the delight in malice
00:54:40 - 00:54:46
are born. The men of corruption are witty and slanderous. They know of types of murder
00:54:46 - 00:54:52
that require neither daggers nor assault. They also know that whatever is said, well,
00:54:52 - 00:55:00
is believed. Fourth, when morals decay, those men emerge whom one calls tyrants. They are
00:55:00 - 00:55:06
the precursors and, as it were, the precocious harbingers of individuals. Only a little while
00:55:06 - 00:55:10
later this fruit of fruits hangs yellow and mellow from the tree of a people, and the
00:55:10 - 00:55:16
tree existed only for the sake of these fruits. Once decay has reached its climax along with
00:55:16 - 00:55:22
the infighting of all sorts of tyrants, the Caesar always appears, the final tyrant who
00:55:22 - 00:55:28
puts an end to the weary struggle for sole rule, by putting weariness to work for himself.
00:55:28 - 00:55:34
In his age, the individual is usually ripest in culture, therefore in its highest and most
00:55:34 - 00:55:39
fruitful stage, but not for his sake or on account of him, although the men of the highest
00:55:39 - 00:55:45
culture like to flatter their Caesar by pretending to be his creation. But in truth, they merely
00:55:45 - 00:55:50
need peace from outside because they have enough unrest and work inside themselves.
00:55:50 - 00:55:55
In these ages, bribery and treason reach their peak, for the love of the newly discovered
00:55:55 - 00:56:01
ego is much more powerful now than the love of the old, used-up fatherland which has been
00:56:01 - 00:56:06
touted to death, and the need to achieve some security from the terrifying ups and downs
00:56:06 - 00:56:12
of fortune opens even nobler hands as soon as anyone who is powerful and rich shows that
00:56:12 - 00:56:18
he is ready to pour gold into them. There is hardly any secure future left, one lives
00:56:18 - 00:56:23
for today, and this state of the soul makes the game easy for all seducers, for one allows
00:56:23 - 00:56:30
oneself to be seduced and bribed only for today, while reserving the future and one's
00:56:30 - 00:56:38
Individuals, being truly in and for themselves, care, as is well known, more for the moment
00:56:38 - 00:56:43
than do their opposites, the herdmen, for they consider themselves no less incalculable
00:56:43 - 00:56:48
than the future. They also like to attach themselves to violent men because they credit
00:56:48 - 00:56:54
themselves with the capacity for actions and for information that the mass of men would
00:56:54 - 00:57:00
neither understand nor forgive, while the tyrant or Caesar understands the rights of
00:57:00 - 00:57:05
the individual, even in his excesses, and has a personal interest in advocating and
00:57:05 - 00:57:10
even abetting a bolder private morality, for he thinks of himself and would like others
00:57:10 - 00:57:15
to think of him in the way Napoleon once expressed in his classical manner, I have the right
00:57:15 - 00:57:21
to answer all accusations against me with an eternal, that's me, I am apart from all
00:57:21 - 00:57:27
the world and accept conditions from nobody, I demand subjection even to my fancies, and
00:57:27 - 00:57:32
people should find it quite natural when I yield to this or that distraction, that is
00:57:32 - 00:57:37
how Napoleon once replied to his wife when she had reasons to question the marital fidelity
00:57:37 - 00:57:43
of her husband, the times of corruption are those when the apples fall from the tree,
00:57:43 - 00:57:47
I mean the individuals, for they carry the seeds of the future and are the authors of
00:57:47 - 00:57:52
the spiritual colonization and origin of new states and communities, corruption is
00:57:52 - 00:58:02
merely a nasty word for the autumn of a people, 24, diverse dissatisfaction, the weak and
00:58:02 - 00:58:07
quasi-feminine type of the dissatisfied has a sensitivity for making life more beautiful
00:58:07 - 00:58:13
and profound, the strong or masculine type to stick to this metaphor has a sensitivity
00:58:13 - 00:58:19
for making life better and safer, the former type manifests its weakness and femininity
00:58:19 - 00:58:25
by gladly being deceived occasionally and settling for a little intoxication and effusive
00:58:25 - 00:58:31
enthusiasm, although it can never be satisfied altogether and suffers from the incurability
00:58:31 - 00:58:36
of its dissatisfaction, moreover this type promotes all those who know how to provide
00:58:36 - 00:58:43
opiates and narcotic consolations and it resents all who esteem physicians above priests, thus
00:58:43 - 00:58:49
it assures the continuation of real misery, if this type had not been super abundant in
00:58:49 - 00:58:54
Europe since the middle ages, the celebrated European capacity for constant change might
00:58:54 - 00:59:00
never have come into existence, for the requirements of the strong among the dissatisfied are too
00:59:00 - 00:59:06
crude and at bottom so undemanding that eventually they can surely be brought to rest, China
00:59:06 - 00:59:11
for example is a country in which large scale dissatisfaction and the capacity for change
00:59:12 - 00:59:18
have become extinct centuries ago and the socialists and state idolaters of Europe with
00:59:18 - 00:59:23
their measures for making life better and safer might easily establish in Europe too
00:59:23 - 00:59:29
Chinese conditions and a Chinese happiness, if only they could first extirpate the sicklier,
00:59:29 - 00:59:35
tenderer, more feminine dissatisfaction and romanticism that at present are still super
00:59:35 - 00:59:42
abundant here, Europe is sick but owes the utmost gratitude to her incurability and to
00:59:42 - 00:59:47
the eternal changes in her affliction, these constantly new conditions and these no less
00:59:47 - 00:59:52
constantly new dangers, pains and media of information have finally generated an intellectual
00:59:52 - 00:59:58
irritability that almost amounts to genius and is in any case the mother of all genius.
00:59:59 - 01:00:08
25. Not predestined for knowledge. There is a stupid humility that is not at all rare and
01:00:08 - 01:00:14
those afflicted with it are altogether unfit to become devotees of knowledge, as soon as a person
01:00:14 - 01:00:20
of this type perceives something striking, he turns on his heel as it were and says to himself,
01:00:20 - 01:00:27
you have made a mistake, what is the matter with your senses, this cannot, may not, be the truth
01:00:27 - 01:00:33
and then instead of looking and listening again more carefully, he runs away from the striking
01:00:33 - 01:00:38
thing as if he had been intimidated and tries to remove it from his mind as fast as he can,
01:00:38 - 01:00:44
for his inner cannon says, I do not want to see anything that contradicts the prevalent opinion,
01:00:44 - 01:00:49
am I called to discover new truths, there are too many old ones as it is.
01:00:50 - 01:00:51
26.
01:00:55 - 01:01:01
What is life? Life, that is continually shedding something that wants to die. Life,
01:01:01 - 01:01:06
that is being cruel and inexorable against everything about us that is growing old and
01:01:06 - 01:01:12
weak and not only about us. Life, that is then, being without reverence for those who are dying,
01:01:13 - 01:01:19
who are wretched, who are ancient, constantly being a murderer and yet old Moses said,
01:01:19 - 01:01:24
thou shalt not kill. 27.
01:01:28 - 01:01:35
The man of renunciation. What does the man of renunciation do? He strives for a higher world,
01:01:35 - 01:01:39
he wants to fly further and higher than all men of affirmation, he throws away much that
01:01:39 - 01:01:45
would encumber his flight, including not a little that he esteems and likes, he sacrifices it to his
01:01:45 - 01:01:51
desire for the heights. This sacrificing, this throwing away, however, is precisely what alone
01:01:51 - 01:01:58
becomes visible and leads people to call him the man of renunciation. It is as such that he confronts
01:01:58 - 01:02:04
us, shrouded in his hood, as if he were the sole of a hair shirt, but he is quite satisfied with
01:02:04 - 01:02:10
the impression he makes on us, he wants to conceal from us his desire, his pride, his intention to
01:02:10 - 01:02:16
soar beyond us. Yes, he is cleverer than we thought and so polite to us, this man of affirmation,
01:02:16 - 01:02:25
for that is what he is, no less than we, even in his renunciation. 28. To be harmful with what is
01:02:25 - 01:02:32
best in us. At times our strengths propel us so far forward that we can no longer endure our
01:02:32 - 01:02:37
weaknesses and perish from them. We may even foresee this outcome without wishing to have it
01:02:37 - 01:02:43
otherwise. Thus we become hard against everything in us that desires consideration and our greatness
01:02:43 - 01:02:50
is also our lack of compassion. Such an experience for which we must pay in the end with our lives
01:02:50 - 01:02:56
is a parable for the whole effect of great human beings on others and on their age. Precisely with
01:02:56 - 01:03:03
what is best in them, with what only they can do, they destroy many who are weak, unsure, still in
01:03:03 - 01:03:10
the process of becoming, of striving, and thus they are harmful. It can even happen that, everything
01:03:10 - 01:03:16
considered, they are only harmful because what is best in them is accepted and absorbed by those
01:03:16 - 01:03:23
alone whom it affects like a drink that is too strong. They lose their understanding and their
01:03:23 - 01:03:28
selfishness and become so intoxicated that they are bound to break their limbs on all the false
01:03:28 - 01:03:39
paths on which their intoxication leads them astray. 29. Add lies. When people in France began
01:03:39 - 01:03:43
to attack the Aristotelian unities and others therefore began to defend them, one could see
01:03:43 - 01:03:50
once again what is to be seen so often but what people hate to see. One lied, mendaciously inventing
01:03:50 - 01:03:55
reasons for these laws simply to avoid admitting that one had become used to these laws and no
01:03:55 - 01:04:02
longer wanted things to be different. The same process occurs, and always has occurred, in every
01:04:02 - 01:04:08
prevalent morality and religion. The reasons and purposes for habits are always lies that are added
01:04:08 - 01:04:14
only after some people begin to attack these habits and to ask for reasons and purposes. At
01:04:14 - 01:04:19
this point the conservatives of all ages are thoroughly dishonest. They add lies.
01:04:19 - 01:04:30
30. The comedy played by the famous. Famous men who need their fame, like all politicians,
01:04:30 - 01:04:36
for example, never choose allies and friends without ulterior motives. From one they desire
01:04:36 - 01:04:42
the reflected splingor of his virtue, from another the fear inspired by some of the dubious qualities
01:04:42 - 01:04:47
that everybody associates with him. From someone else they steal the reputation of his leisure,
01:04:47 - 01:04:53
his lying in the sun, because it serves their own purposes to appear inattentive and idle at times.
01:04:53 - 01:04:59
This conceals the fact that they actually lie in wait. Now they need a dreamer near them,
01:04:59 - 01:05:07
now an expert, now a thinker, now a pedant, as if he were their alter ego, but soon they do not
01:05:07 - 01:05:13
need them anymore. Thus the surroundings and exteriors of famous men die continually,
01:05:13 - 01:05:19
even while everybody seems to be pushing to get near them and lend them his own character. In this,
01:05:19 - 01:05:24
they resemble great cities. Their reputation keeps changing like their character,
01:05:24 - 01:05:29
for their changing instruments demand these changes and push now this and now.
01:05:29 - 01:05:35
that real or fictitious quality out onto the stage. Their friends and allies belong, as
01:05:35 - 01:05:41
I have said, to these stage qualities. What they wish, on the other hand, must stand that
01:05:41 - 01:05:47
much more firmly and unmoved, its splendor visible from a distance, and this, too, occasionally
01:05:47 - 01:05:56
requires a comedy and a stage play. 31. Trade and nobility.
01:05:56 - 01:06:01
Hunting and selling have become common, like the art of reading and writing. Everybody
01:06:01 - 01:06:06
has practiced it even if he is no tradesman, and gets more practice every day, just as
01:06:06 - 01:06:13
formerly, when men were more savage, everybody was a hunter and practiced that art, day after
01:06:13 - 01:06:18
day. Then hunting was common, but eventually it became a privilege of the powerful and
01:06:18 - 01:06:24
noble. It lost its everyday character and its commonness because it ceased to be necessary.
01:06:24 - 01:06:31
It became a matter of moods and luxury. The same might happen some day to buying and selling.
01:06:31 - 01:06:35
One can imagine social conditions in which there is no buying and selling, and in which
01:06:35 - 01:06:41
this art gradually ceases to be necessary. Perhaps some individuals who are less subject
01:06:41 - 01:06:45
to the laws of the general condition will then permit themselves to buy and sell as
01:06:45 - 01:06:51
a luxury of sentiment. At that point, trade would acquire nobility, and the nobility might
01:06:51 - 01:06:57
then enjoy trading as much as they have hitherto enjoyed war and politics, while the esteem
01:06:57 - 01:07:03
for politics might undergo a total change. Even now it is ceasing to be the art of the
01:07:03 - 01:07:09
nobleman, and it is quite possible that some day one may find it so common and even vulgar
01:07:09 - 01:07:15
that along with all party literature and journalism, one would classify it as prostitution of the
01:07:15 - 01:07:24
spirit. 32. Undesirable Disciples.
01:07:24 - 01:07:28
What shall I do with these two young men? cried a disgruntled philosopher who corrupted
01:07:28 - 01:07:35
youth as Socrates had once done. They are unwelcome students. This one cannot say, no.
01:07:35 - 01:07:40
And that one says to everything, half and half. Supposing that they adopted my doctrine,
01:07:41 - 01:07:47
too much, for my way of thinking requires a warlike soul, a desire to hurt, a delight
01:07:47 - 01:07:54
in saying no, a hard skin, he would slowly die of open and internal wounds, and the other
01:07:54 - 01:07:59
one would make some personal compromise with every cause he represents, and thus compromise
01:07:59 - 01:08:09
it. Such a disciple I wish my enemy. 33. Outside the Lecture Hall.
01:08:09 - 01:08:13
In order to prove to you that man is at bottom one of the good-natured animals, I should
01:08:13 - 01:08:20
like to remind you how credulous he has been for such a long time. Only now has he become,
01:08:20 - 01:08:27
very late and after an immense self-conquest, a mistrustful animal. Yes, man is now more
01:08:27 - 01:08:33
evil than ever before. I do not understand this. Why should man be more mistrustful and
01:08:33 - 01:08:38
evil now? Because he now has, and needs, a science.
01:08:38 - 01:08:48
34. Historia Abscondita. Every great human being exerts a retroactive force. For his sake,
01:08:48 - 01:08:53
all of history is placed in the balance again, and a thousand secrets of the past crawl out
01:08:53 - 01:08:58
of their hiding places, into his sunshine. There is no way of telling what may yet become
01:08:58 - 01:09:04
part of history. Perhaps the past is still essentially undiscovered. So many retroactive
01:09:04 - 01:09:13
forces are still needed. 35. Heresy and Witchcraft.
01:09:13 - 01:09:17
Thinking in a way that is not customary is much less the result of a superior intellect
01:09:17 - 01:09:23
than it is the result of strong, evil inclinations that detach and isolate one, and that are
01:09:23 - 01:09:29
defiant, nasty, and malicious. Heresy is the pendant of witchcraft and surely no more
01:09:29 - 01:09:35
harmless and least of all, anything essentially venerable. Heretics and witches are two species
01:09:35 - 01:09:41
of evil human beings. What they have in common is that they also feel that they are evil,
01:09:41 - 01:09:46
but are impelled by an unconquerable lust to harm what is dominant, whether people or
01:09:46 - 01:09:51
opinions. The Reformation, which was in a way a redoubled intensification of the medieval
01:09:51 - 01:09:56
spirit at a time when that was no longer accompanied by a good conscience, produced
01:09:56 - 01:10:04
both in the greatest abundance. 36. Last Words.
01:10:04 - 01:10:08
It will be recalled that the Emperor Augustus, that terrible man who had as much self-control
01:10:08 - 01:10:14
and could be as silent as any wise Socrates, became indiscreet at his own expense when
01:10:14 - 01:10:19
he uttered his last words. For the first time he dropped his mask by implying that he had
01:10:19 - 01:10:24
worn a mask and played a comedy. He had played the father of the fatherland and wisdom on
01:10:24 - 01:10:33
the throne well enough to create the illusion. Plaudite amici, comoedia finita est. The idea
01:10:33 - 01:10:40
of the dying Nero, qualis artefacts pareo, was also the idea of the dying Augustus, an
01:10:40 - 01:10:47
actor's vanity, an actor's garrulity, truly the opposite of the dying Socrates. But Tiberius
01:10:47 - 01:10:53
died silently. This most tormented of all self-tormenters was genuine and no actor.
01:10:53 - 01:11:00
What may have passed through his mind in the end? Perhaps this life is a long death. Fool
01:11:00 - 01:11:06
that I was to shorten the lives of so many! Was I made to be a benefactor? I should have
01:11:06 - 01:11:11
given them eternal life. Then I could have watched them die forever. For that I had such
01:11:11 - 01:11:18
good eyes, qualis spectator, pareo. When after a long struggle with death he seemed to recover
01:11:18 - 01:11:23
his strength again, it was considered advisable to suffocate him with bed pillows. He died a
01:11:23 - 01:11:29
double death. 37. Owing to Three Errors.
01:11:29 - 01:11:35
During the last century science has been promoted, partly because it was by means of science that
01:11:35 - 01:11:39
one hoped to understand God's goodness and wisdom best. This was the main motive of the
01:11:39 - 01:11:45
great Englishman like Newton. Partly because one believed in the absolute utility of knowledge,
01:11:45 - 01:11:51
and especially in the most intimate association of morality, knowledge, and happiness. This was
01:11:51 - 01:11:56
the main motive of the great Frenchman like Voltaire. Partly because one thought that in
01:11:56 - 01:12:01
science one possessed and loved something unselfish, harmless, self-sufficient, and
01:12:01 - 01:12:08
truly innocent, in which man's evil impulses had no part whatever. The main motive of Spinoza,
01:12:08 - 01:12:13
who felt divine when attaining knowledge, in sum, owing to three errors.
01:12:13 - 01:12:18
38. The Explosive Ones.
01:12:18 - 01:12:25
When one considers how much the energy of young men needs to explode, one is not surprised that
01:12:25 - 01:12:31
they decide for this cause or that without being at all subtle or choosy. What attracts them is
01:12:31 - 01:12:35
the sight of the zeal that surrounds a cause, as it were, the sight of the burning fuse,
01:12:36 - 01:12:42
and not the cause itself. Subtle seducers therefore know the art of arousing expectations
01:12:42 - 01:12:47
of an explosion, while making no effort to furnish reasons for their cause. Reasons are
01:12:47 - 01:12:55
not what wins over such powder kegs. 39. Changed Taste.
01:12:55 - 01:13:01
The change in general taste is more powerful than that of opinions. Opinions, along with all proofs,
01:13:02 - 01:13:07
refutations, and the whole intellectual masquerade, are merely symptoms of the
01:13:07 - 01:13:10
change in taste, and most certainly not what they are still often supposed to be,
01:13:10 - 01:13:18
its causes. What changes the general taste? The fact that some individuals who are powerful and
01:13:18 - 01:13:25
influential announce without any shame, hoc est ridiculum, hoc est absurdum, in short,
01:13:25 - 01:13:31
the judgment of their taste and nausea, and then they enforce it tyrannically. Thus they
01:13:31 - 01:13:37
coerce many, and gradually still more develop a new habit, and eventually all a new need.
01:13:37 - 01:13:44
The reason why these individuals have different feelings and tastes is usually to be found in
01:13:44 - 01:13:50
some oddity of their lifestyle, nutrition, or digestion, perhaps a deficit or excess of
01:13:50 - 01:13:58
inorganic salts in their blood and brain. In brief, in their physis. They have the courage to side
01:13:58 - 01:14:04
with their physis, and to heed its demands down to the subtlest nuances. Their aesthetic and moral
01:14:04 - 01:14:13
judgments are among these subtlest nuances of the physis. 40. On the Lack of Noble Manners.
01:14:13 - 01:14:19
Soldiers and leaders still have far better relationships with each other than workers
01:14:19 - 01:14:25
and employers. So far, at least, culture that rests on a military basis still towers above
01:14:25 - 01:14:30
all so-called industrial culture. The latter in its present shape is altogether the most
01:14:30 - 01:14:37
vulgar form of existence that has yet existed. Here one is at the mercy of brute need. One wants
01:14:37 - 01:14:43
to live and has to sell oneself, but one despises those who exploit this need and buy the worker.
01:14:43 - 01:14:50
Oddly, submission to powerful, frightening, even terrible persons, like tyrants and generals,
01:14:50 - 01:14:56
is not experienced as nearly so painful as is this submission to unknown and uninteresting
01:14:56 - 01:15:01
persons, which is what all the luminaries of industry are. What the workers see in the
01:15:01 - 01:15:07
employer is usually only a cunning, blood-sucking dog of a man who speculates on all misery,
01:15:07 - 01:15:14
and the employer's name, shape, manner, and reputation are a matter of complete indifference
01:15:14 - 01:15:20
to them. The manufacturers and entrepreneurs of business probably have been too deficient
01:15:20 - 01:15:26
so far in all those forms and signs of a higher race that alone make a person interesting. If
01:15:26 - 01:15:32
the nobility of birth showed in their eyes and gestures, there might not be any socialism of
01:15:32 - 01:15:38
the masses, for at bottom the masses are willing to submit to slavery of any kind, if only the
01:15:38 - 01:15:44
higher-ups constantly legitimize themselves as higher, as born to command, by having noble
01:15:44 - 01:15:51
manners. The most common man feels that nobility cannot be improvised and that one has to honor in
01:15:51 - 01:15:57
it the fruit of long periods of time, but the lack of higher manners and the notorious vulgarity of
01:15:57 - 01:16:03
manufacturers with their ruddy, fat hands give him the idea that it is only accident and luck
01:16:03 - 01:16:10
that have elevated one person above another. Well then, he reasons, let us try accident and
01:16:10 - 01:16:21
luck, let us throw the dice, and thus socialism is born. 41. Against Remorse. A thinker sees his
01:16:21 - 01:16:26
own actions as experiments and questions, as attempts to find out something. Success and
01:16:26 - 01:16:31
failure are for him answers above all. To be annoyed or feel remorse because something goes
01:16:31 - 01:16:36
wrong, that he leaves to those who act because they have received orders and who have to reckon
01:16:37 - 01:16:47
with a beating when his lordship is not satisfied with the result. 42. Work and Boredom. Looking for
01:16:47 - 01:16:53
work in order to be paid. In civilized countries today almost all men are at one in doing that,
01:16:53 - 01:16:59
for all of them work is a means and not an end in itself. Hence they are not very refined in
01:16:59 - 01:17:04
their choice of work if only it pays well, but there are, if only rarely, men who would rather
01:17:04 - 01:17:11
perish than work without any pleasure in their work. They are choosy, hard to satisfy, and do
01:17:11 - 01:17:18
not care for ample rewards if the work itself is not the reward of rewards. Artists and contemplative
01:17:18 - 01:17:24
men of all kinds belong to this rare breed, but so do even those men of leisure who spend their
01:17:24 - 01:17:31
lives hunting, traveling, or in love affairs and adventures. All of these desire work and misery
01:17:31 - 01:17:38
if only it is associated with pleasure and the hardest most difficult work if necessary. Otherwise
01:17:38 - 01:17:44
their idleness is resolute even if it spells impoverishment, dishonor, and danger to life and
01:17:44 - 01:17:50
limb. They do not fear boredom as much as work without pleasure. They actually require a lot
01:17:50 - 01:17:55
of boredom if their work is to succeed. For thinkers and all sensitive spirits boredom is
01:17:55 - 01:18:01
that disagreeable, windless calm of the soul that precedes a happy voyage and cheerful winds.
01:18:01 - 01:18:07
They have to bear it and must wait for its effect on them. Precisely this is what lesser natures
01:18:07 - 01:18:15
cannot achieve by any means. To ward off boredom at any cost is vulgar, no less than work without
01:18:15 - 01:18:21
pleasure. Perhaps Asians are distinguished above Europeans by a capacity for longer,
01:18:21 - 01:18:27
deeper calm. Even their opiates have a slow effect and require patience as opposed to the
01:18:27 - 01:18:38
disgusting suddenness of the European poison, alcohol. 43. What laws betray? It is a serious
01:18:38 - 01:18:42
mistake to study the penal code of a people as if it gave expression to the national character.
01:18:42 - 01:18:47
The laws do not betray what a people are but rather what seems to them foreign, strange,
01:18:47 - 01:18:54
uncanny, outlandish. The laws refer to the exceptions to the morality of mores and the
01:18:54 - 01:19:00
severest penalties are provided for what accords with the mores of a neighboring people. Thus,
01:19:00 - 01:19:04
the Wahhabis know only two mortal sins, having a god other than the Wahhabi God,
01:19:04 - 01:19:11
and smoking, which they call the infamous way of drinking. And what about murder and adultery,
01:19:11 - 01:19:18
asked the Englishman who found this out, amazed. God is gracious and merciful, replied the old
01:19:18 - 01:19:25
chief. Thus, the old Romans had the notion that a woman could incur only two mortal sins, adultery
01:19:25 - 01:19:32
and drinking wine. Old Cato thought that kissing among relatives had been made part of mores only
01:19:32 - 01:19:37
to keep women under control in this matter. The meaning of the kiss? Does she smell of wine?
01:19:37 - 01:19:43
Women caught with wine were actually put to death, certainly not only because women under
01:19:43 - 01:19:49
the influence of alcohol sometimes lose the ability to say no. What the Romans feared above
01:19:49 - 01:19:55
all was the orgiastic and Dionysian cult that afflicted the women of southern Europe from time
01:19:55 - 01:20:01
to time when wine was still new in Europe. This struck the Romans as a monstrous foreign invasion
01:20:01 - 01:20:07
that overturned the basis of the European sensibility. It seemed treason against Rome,
01:20:07 - 01:20:14
the incorporation of what was foreign. 44. Supposed Motives
01:20:14 - 01:20:21
Important as it may be to know the motives that actually prompted human conduct so far,
01:20:21 - 01:20:25
it may be even more essential to know the fictitious and fanciful motives to which men
01:20:25 - 01:20:31
ascribe their conduct. For their inner happiness and misery has come to men depending on their
01:20:31 - 01:20:37
faith in this or that motive, not by virtue of the actual motives. The latter are of second-order
01:20:37 - 01:20:42
interest. 45. Epicurus
01:20:42 - 01:20:48
Yes, I am proud of the fact that I experience the character of Epicurus quite differently
01:20:48 - 01:20:53
from perhaps everybody else. Whatever I hear or read of him I enjoy the happiness of the
01:20:53 - 01:21:00
afternoon of antiquity. I see his eyes gaze upon a wide white sea, across rocks at the shore that
01:21:00 - 01:21:06
are bathed in sunlight, while large and small animals are playing in this light, as secure
01:21:06 - 01:21:12
and calm as the light and his eyes. Such happiness could be invented only by a man who was suffering
01:21:12 - 01:21:17
continually. It is the happiness of eyes that have seen the sea of existence become calm,
01:21:17 - 01:21:23
and now they can never weary of the surface and of the many hues of this tender, shuddering skin
01:21:23 - 01:21:28
of the sea. Never before has voluptuousness been so modest.
01:21:29 - 01:21:32
46. Our Amazement
01:21:32 - 01:21:38
It is a profound and fundamental good fortune that scientific discoveries stand up under
01:21:38 - 01:21:43
examination and furnish the basis, again and again, for further discoveries. After all,
01:21:43 - 01:21:49
this could be otherwise. Indeed, we are so convinced of the uncertainty and fantasies
01:21:49 - 01:21:54
of our judgments and of the eternal change of all human laws and concepts that we are
01:21:54 - 01:22:00
really amazed how well the results of sensei stand up. Formerly, nothing was known of this
01:22:00 - 01:22:05
fickleness of everything human. The moors of morality sustained the faith that all of man's
01:22:05 - 01:22:12
inner life was attached to iron necessity with eternal clamps. Perhaps people then experienced
01:22:12 - 01:22:17
a similarly voluptuous amazement when they listened to fairy tales. The miraculous gave
01:22:17 - 01:22:23
a great deal of pleasure to those who at times grew tired of the rule and of eternity. To lose
01:22:23 - 01:22:30
firm ground for once, to float, to err, to be mad. That was part of the paradise and the debauchery
01:22:30 - 01:22:36
of bygone ages, while our bliss is like that of a man who has suffered shipwreck, climbed ashore,
01:22:36 - 01:22:41
and now stands with both feet on the firm old earth, amazed that it does not waver.
01:22:41 - 01:22:47
47. On the Suppression of the Passions
01:22:47 - 01:22:53
If one continually forbids oneself the expression of the passions as if that were something to be
01:22:53 - 01:22:59
left to common, coarser, bourgeois, or peasant types, desiring to suppress not the passions
01:22:59 - 01:23:04
themselves but only their language and gestures, the result is nevertheless precisely what is
01:23:04 - 01:23:09
not desired, the suppression of the passions themselves, or at least their weakening and
01:23:09 - 01:23:15
alteration. The most instructive example is furnished by the court of Louis XIV and all
01:23:15 - 01:23:20
the circles that were dependent on the court. The period that followed, having been educated to
01:23:20 - 01:23:26
suppress their expression, lacked the passions themselves and had in their place graceful,
01:23:26 - 01:23:33
shallow, playful manners. It was an age marked by the incapacity for bad manners. Even an insult
01:23:33 - 01:23:39
was accepted and returned with obliging words. Perhaps our present age furnishes the most
01:23:39 - 01:23:45
remarkable counterpart. Everywhere, in life and on the stage, and not least of all in everything
01:23:45 - 01:23:50
that is written, I see the delight in all the coarser eruptions and gestures of passion.
01:23:51 - 01:23:57
What is demanded nowadays is a certain convention of passionateness, anything but genuine passion.
01:23:57 - 01:24:02
Nevertheless, eventually passion itself will be reached this way, and our descendants will
01:24:02 - 01:24:06
not only indulge in savage and unruly forms, but will be really savage.
01:24:06 - 01:24:12
48. Knowledge of Misery.
01:24:12 - 01:24:18
Perhaps there is nothing that separates men or ages more profoundly than a difference in
01:24:18 - 01:24:24
their knowledge of misery, misery of the soul as well as the body. Regarding the latter,
01:24:24 - 01:24:30
we moderns may well be, all of us, in spite of our frailties and infirmities, tyros,
01:24:30 - 01:24:36
who rely on fantasies, for lack of any ample first-hand experience, compared to the age of
01:24:36 - 01:24:43
fear, the longest of all ages, in which individuals had to protect themselves. In those days,
01:24:43 - 01:24:49
one received ample training in bodily torments and deprivations, and one understood even a
01:24:49 - 01:24:55
certain cruelty against oneself, and a voluntary habituation to pain as a necessary means of
01:24:55 - 01:25:02
self-preservation. In those days, one educated those close to one to endure pain. In those days,
01:25:02 - 01:25:07
one enjoyed inflicting pain and saw the worst things of this kind happen to others,
01:25:07 - 01:25:13
without feeling anything but. One's own safety. But regarding misery of the soul,
01:25:13 - 01:25:18
I now look at every person to see whether he knows this from experience, or only from
01:25:18 - 01:25:23
descriptions, whether he still considers it necessary to simulate this knowledge, say,
01:25:23 - 01:25:29
as a sign of refinement, or whether, at the bottom of his soul, he no longer believes in
01:25:29 - 01:25:33
great pains of the soul, and has much the same experience, when they are mentioned,
01:25:33 - 01:25:38
that he has at the mention of great physical sufferings, which make him think of his own
01:25:38 - 01:25:43
toothaches and stomachaches. But that is how matters seem to me to stand with most people
01:25:43 - 01:25:49
today. The general lack of experience of pain of both kinds, and the relative rarity of the
01:25:49 - 01:25:54
sight of anyone who is suffering, have an important consequence. Pain is now hated much
01:25:54 - 01:26:00
more than was the case formerly. One speaks much worse of it. Indeed, one considers the
01:26:00 - 01:26:05
existence of the mere thought of pain scarcely endurable, and turns it into a reproach against
01:26:05 - 01:26:11
the whole of existence. The emergence of pessimistic philosophies is by no means a sign
01:26:11 - 01:26:17
of great and terrible misery. No. These question marks about the value of all life are put up in
01:26:17 - 01:26:23
ages in which the refinement and alleviation of existence make even the inevitable mosquito bites
01:26:23 - 01:26:30
and the body seem much too bloody and malignant. And one is so poor in real experiences of pain,
01:26:30 - 01:26:37
that one would like to consider painful general ideas as suffering of the first order. There is
01:26:37 - 01:26:42
a recipe against pessimistic philosophers and the excessive sensitivity that seems to me the real
01:26:42 - 01:26:49
misery of the present age. But this recipe may sound too cruel, and might itself be counted
01:26:49 - 01:26:55
among the signs that lead people to judge that existence is something evil. Well,
01:26:55 - 01:27:06
the recipe against this misery is misery. 49. Magnanimity and related matters. Those
01:27:06 - 01:27:11
paradoxical phenomena, like the sudden chill in the behavior of an emotional person or the humor
01:27:11 - 01:27:17
of a melancholic, and above all magnanimity as a sudden renunciation of revenge or of the
01:27:17 - 01:27:20
satisfaction of envy, appear in people's minds.
01:27:19 - 01:27:26
people who harbor a powerful centrifugal force and experience sudden satiety and sudden nausea.
01:27:26 - 01:27:31
Their satisfactions are so quick and strong that they are followed instantly by weariness
01:27:31 - 01:27:36
and aversion and a flight into the opposite taste.
01:27:36 - 01:27:42
In this opposite, the cramp of feeling is resolved, in one person by a sudden chill,
01:27:42 - 01:27:48
in another by laughter, in a third person by tears of self-sacrifice.
01:27:48 - 01:27:53
The magnanimous person, or at least the type of magnanimity that has always been considered
01:27:53 - 01:27:59
most impressive, appears to me as an extremely vengeful person, who beholds satisfaction
01:27:59 - 01:28:06
so close at hand, and who drains it so fully and thoroughly to the last drop in anticipation
01:28:06 - 01:28:13
that a tremendous and quick nausea follows this quick orgy, and he now rises above himself,
01:28:13 - 01:28:18
as they say, and forgives his enemy and even blesses and honors him.
01:28:18 - 01:28:23
With this violence against himself, with this scorn for his lust for revenge that
01:28:23 - 01:28:29
a moment ago was still so powerful, he merely yields to a new impulse that has now attained
01:28:29 - 01:28:35
power over him, nausea, and he does this just as impatiently and orgiastically as he anticipated
01:28:35 - 01:28:42
a moment earlier the delight in revenge, draining it in his imagination.
01:28:42 - 01:28:48
Magnanimity contains the same degree of egoism as does revenge, but egoism of a different
01:28:48 - 01:28:50
quality.
01:28:50 - 01:28:52
50.
01:28:52 - 01:28:55
The Argument of Growing Solitude.
01:28:55 - 01:28:59
The reproaches of conscience are weak, even in the most conscientious people compared
01:28:59 - 01:29:05
to the feeling, this or that is against the morals of your society.
01:29:05 - 01:29:10
A cold look or a sneer on the face of those among whom and for whom one has been educated
01:29:10 - 01:29:13
is feared even by the strongest.
01:29:13 - 01:29:16
What is it that they are really afraid of?
01:29:16 - 01:29:18
Growing solitude.
01:29:18 - 01:29:24
This is the argument that rebuts even the best arguments for a person or cause.
01:29:24 - 01:29:27
Thus the herd instinct speaks up in us.
01:29:27 - 01:29:29
51.
01:29:29 - 01:29:31
Truthfulness.
01:29:31 - 01:29:38
I favor any skeptic to which I may reply, let us try it.
01:29:38 - 01:29:42
But I no longer wish to hear anything of all those things and questions that do not permit
01:29:42 - 01:29:44
any experiment.
01:29:44 - 01:29:50
This is the limit of my truthfulness, for their courage has lost its right.
01:29:50 - 01:29:53
52.
01:29:53 - 01:29:55
What Others Know About Us.
01:29:55 - 01:29:59
What we know about ourselves and remember is not so decisive for the happiness of our
01:29:59 - 01:30:01
life as people suppose.
01:30:01 - 01:30:06
One day that which others know about us, or think they know, assaults us, and then we
01:30:06 - 01:30:09
realize that this is more powerful.
01:30:09 - 01:30:14
It is easier to cope with a bad conscience than to cope with a bad reputation.
01:30:14 - 01:30:17
53.
01:30:17 - 01:30:18
Where the Good Begins.
01:30:18 - 01:30:23
Where the poor power of the eye can no longer see the evil impulse as such because it has
01:30:23 - 01:30:27
become too subtle, man posits the realm of goodness.
01:30:27 - 01:30:32
And the feeling that we have now entered the realm of goodness excites all those impulses
01:30:32 - 01:30:37
which had been threatened and limited by the evil impulses, like the feeling of security,
01:30:37 - 01:30:40
of comfort, of benevolence.
01:30:40 - 01:30:44
Hence the duller the eye, the more extensive the good.
01:30:44 - 01:30:48
Hence the eternal cheerfulness of the common people and of children.
01:30:48 - 01:30:54
Hence the gloominess and grief, akin to a bad conscience, of the great thinkers.
01:30:54 - 01:30:57
54.
01:30:57 - 01:30:59
The Consciousness of Appearance.
01:30:59 - 01:31:03
How wonderful and new, and yet how gruesome and ironic I find my position vis-à-vis the
01:31:03 - 01:31:06
whole of existence in the light of my insight.
01:31:06 - 01:31:12
I have discovered for myself that the human and animal past, indeed the whole primal age,
01:31:12 - 01:31:19
and past of all sentient being continues in me to invent, to love, to hate, and to infer.
01:31:19 - 01:31:24
I suddenly woke ye up in the midst of this dream, but only to the consciousness that
01:31:24 - 01:31:30
I am dreaming, and that I must go on dreaming lest I perish, as a somnambulist must go on
01:31:30 - 01:31:33
dreaming lest he fall.
01:31:33 - 01:31:35
What is appearance for me now?
01:31:35 - 01:31:38
Certainly not the opposite of some essence.
01:31:38 - 01:31:43
What could I say about any essence except to name the attributes of its appearance?
01:31:43 - 01:31:49
Certainly not a dead mask that one could place on an unknown X or remove from it.
01:31:49 - 01:31:54
Appearance is for me that which lives and is effective and goes so far in its self-mockery
01:31:54 - 01:31:59
that it makes me feel that this is appearance and will-o'-the-wisp, and a dance of spirits
01:31:59 - 01:32:07
and nothing more, that among all these dreamers I, too, who know, am dancing my dance, that
01:32:07 - 01:32:12
the knower is a means for prolonging the earthly dance and thus belongs to the masters of ceremony
01:32:12 - 01:32:18
of existence, and that the sublime consistency and interrelatedness of all knowledge perhaps
01:32:18 - 01:32:23
is and will be the highest means to preserve the universality of dreaming and the mutual
01:32:23 - 01:32:31
comprehension of all dreamers, and thus also the continuation of the dream.
01:32:31 - 01:32:36
55.
01:32:36 - 01:32:39
The Ultimate Noble-Mindedness Undone.
01:32:39 - 01:32:41
What makes a person noble?
01:32:41 - 01:32:45
Certainly not making sacrifices, for those frantic with lust also make sacrifices.
01:32:45 - 01:32:48
Certainly not following some passion, for there are contemptible passions.
01:32:48 - 01:32:52
Certainly not doing something for others without selfishness.
01:32:52 - 01:32:55
Perhaps nobody is more consistently selfish than those who are noble.
01:32:55 - 01:33:01
Rather, the passion that attacks those who are noble is peculiar, and they fail to realize
01:33:01 - 01:33:02
this.
01:33:02 - 01:33:07
It involves the use of a rare and singular standard, and almost a madness, the feeling
01:33:07 - 01:33:13
of heat in things that feel cold to everybody else, the discovery of values for which no
01:33:13 - 01:33:19
scales have been invented yet, offering sacrifices on altars that are dedicated to an unknown
01:33:19 - 01:33:25
standard, a courage without any desire for honors, a self-sufficiency that overflows
01:33:25 - 01:33:27
and gives to men and things.
01:33:27 - 01:33:33
Hitherto it was rarity, and a lack of awareness of this rarity that made a person noble.
01:33:33 - 01:33:38
But we should note that this standard involved an unfair judgment concerning everything usual,
01:33:38 - 01:33:45
near, and indispensable, in short, that which most preserves the species, and was the rule
01:33:45 - 01:33:47
among men hitherto.
01:33:47 - 01:33:50
All this was slandered on the whole in favor of the exceptions.
01:33:50 - 01:33:54
To become the advocate of the rule, that might be the ultimate form and refinement in which
01:33:54 - 01:33:57
noble-mindedness reveals itself on earth.
01:33:57 - 01:34:01
56.
01:34:01 - 01:34:05
The Craving for Suffering When I think of the craving to do something,
01:34:05 - 01:34:10
which continually tickles and spurs those millions of young Europeans who cannot endure
01:34:10 - 01:34:15
their boredom and themselves, then I realize that they must have a craving to suffer and
01:34:15 - 01:34:21
to find in their suffering a probable reason for action, for deeds.
01:34:21 - 01:34:23
Neediness is needed.
01:34:23 - 01:34:27
Hence the politicians' clamor, hence the many false, fictitious, exaggerated conditions
01:34:27 - 01:34:33
of distress, of all sorts of classes, and the blind readiness to believe in them.
01:34:33 - 01:34:38
These young people demand that, not happiness, but unhappiness should approach from the outside
01:34:38 - 01:34:44
and become visible, and their imagination is busy in advance to turn it into a monster
01:34:44 - 01:34:47
so that afterward they can fight a monster.
01:34:47 - 01:34:52
If these people who crave distress felt the strength inside themselves to benefit themselves
01:34:52 - 01:34:57
and to do something for themselves internally, then they would also know how to create for
01:34:57 - 01:35:02
themselves internally their very own authentic distress.
01:35:02 - 01:35:06
Then their inventions might be more refined and their satisfactions might sound like good
01:35:06 - 01:35:12
music, while at present they fill the world with their clamor about distress and all too
01:35:12 - 01:35:16
often introduce into it the feeling of distress.
01:35:16 - 01:35:20
They do not know what to do with themselves, and therefore paint the distress of others
01:35:20 - 01:35:21
on the wall.
01:35:21 - 01:35:27
They always need others, and continually other others.
01:35:27 - 01:35:33
Pardon me, my friends, I have ventured to paint my happiness on the wall.
01:35:33 - 01:35:35
Book II.
01:35:35 - 01:35:38
57.
01:35:38 - 01:35:40
To the Realists.
01:35:40 - 01:35:45
You sober people who feel well-armed against passion and fantasies, and would like to turn
01:35:45 - 01:35:48
your emptiness into a matter of pride and an ornament.
01:35:48 - 01:35:53
You call yourselves realists and hint that the world really is the way it appears to
01:35:53 - 01:35:59
you, as if reality stood unveiled before you, only, and you yourselves were perhaps the
01:35:59 - 01:36:03
best part of it, O you beloved images of Saiz.
01:36:03 - 01:36:08
But in your unveiled state are not even you still very passionate and dark creatures compared
01:36:08 - 01:36:12
to fish, and still far too similar to an artist in love?
01:36:12 - 01:36:15
And what is reality for an artist in love?
01:36:15 - 01:36:20
You are still burdened with those estimates of things that have their origin in the passions
01:36:20 - 01:36:22
and loves of former centuries.
01:36:22 - 01:36:27
Your sobriety still contains a secret and inextinguishable drunkenness.
01:36:27 - 01:36:32
Your love of reality, for example, O that is a primeval love.
01:36:32 - 01:36:37
Every feeling and sensation contains a piece of this old love.
01:36:37 - 01:36:43
And some fantasy, some prejudice, some unreason, some ignorance, some fear, and ever so much
01:36:43 - 01:36:46
else has contributed to it and worked on it.
01:36:46 - 01:36:52
That mountain there, that cloud there, what is real in that?
01:36:52 - 01:36:57
Subtract the phantasm and every human contribution from it, my sober friends.
01:36:57 - 01:37:02
If you can, if you can forget your descent, your past, your training, all of your humanity
01:37:02 - 01:37:09
and animality, there is no reality for us, not for you either, my sober friends.
01:37:09 - 01:37:14
We are not nearly as different as you think, and perhaps our goodwill to transcend intoxication
01:37:14 - 01:37:21
is as respectable as your faith that you are altogether incapable of intoxication.
01:37:21 - 01:37:25
58.
01:37:25 - 01:37:28
Reality As Creators
01:37:28 - 01:37:32
This has given me the greatest trouble and still does, to realize that what things are
01:37:32 - 01:37:36
called is incomparably more important than what they are.
01:37:36 - 01:37:42
The reputation, name, and appearance, the usual measure and weight of a thing, what
01:37:42 - 01:37:48
it counts for, originally almost always wrong and arbitrary, thrown over things like a dress
01:37:48 - 01:37:53
and altogether foreign to their nature and even to their skin, all this grows from generation
01:37:53 - 01:37:59
unto generation, merely because people believe in it, until it gradually grows to be part
01:37:59 - 01:38:03
of the thing and turns into its very body.
01:38:03 - 01:38:08
What at first was appearance becomes in the end, almost invariably, the essence and is
01:38:08 - 01:38:11
effective as such.
01:38:11 - 01:38:15
How foolish it would be to suppose that one only needs to point out this origin and this
01:38:15 - 01:38:20
misty shroud of delusion in order to destroy the world that counts for real, so-called
01:38:20 - 01:38:22
reality.
01:38:22 - 01:38:25
We can destroy only as creators.
01:38:25 - 01:38:27
But let us not forget this either.
01:38:27 - 01:38:32
It is enough to create new names and estimations and probabilities in order to create, in the
01:38:32 - 01:38:36
long run, new things.
01:38:36 - 01:38:39
59.
01:38:39 - 01:38:41
We Artists
01:38:41 - 01:38:46
When we love a woman, we easily conceive a hatred for nature on account of all the repulsive
01:38:46 - 01:38:49
natural functions to which every woman is subject.
01:38:49 - 01:38:54
We prefer not to think of all this, but when our soul touches on these matters for once,
01:38:54 - 01:38:58
it shrugs, as it were, and looks contemptuously at nature.
01:38:58 - 01:39:00
We feel insulted.
01:39:00 - 01:39:06
Nature seems to encroach on our possessions and with the profanest hands at that.
01:39:06 - 01:39:11
Then we refuse to pay any heed to physiology and decree secretly.
01:39:11 - 01:39:15
I want to hear nothing about the fact that a human being is something more than soul
01:39:15 - 01:39:16
and form.
01:39:16 - 01:39:22
The human being under the skin is for all lovers a horror and unthinkable, a blasphemy
01:39:22 - 01:39:24
against God and love.
01:39:24 - 01:39:29
Well, as lovers still feel about nature and natural functions, every worshiper of God
01:39:29 - 01:39:33
and his holy omnipotence formerly felt.
01:39:33 - 01:39:39
Everything said about nature by astronomers, geologists, physiologists, or physicians struck
01:39:39 - 01:39:45
him as an encroachment into his precious possessions and, hence, as an attack, and a shameless
01:39:45 - 01:39:47
one at that.
01:39:47 - 01:39:52
Even natural law sounded to him like a slander against God.
01:39:52 - 01:39:56
Really he would have much preferred to see all of mechanics derived from acts of a moral
01:39:56 - 01:39:59
will or an arbitrary will.
01:39:59 - 01:40:03
But since nobody was able to render him this service, he ignored nature and mechanics as
01:40:03 - 01:40:06
best he could and lived in a dream.
01:40:06 - 01:40:11
Oh, these men of former times knew how to dream and did not find it necessary to go
01:40:11 - 01:40:17
to sleep first, and we men of today still master this art all too well despite all of
01:40:17 - 01:40:21
our good will toward the day and staying awake.
01:40:21 - 01:40:27
It is quite enough to love, to hate, to desire, simply to feel, and right away the spirit
01:40:27 - 01:40:33
and power of the dream overcome us, and with our eyes open, coldly contemptuous of all
01:40:33 - 01:40:39
danger, we climb up on the most hazardous paths to scale the roofs and spires of fantasy
01:40:39 - 01:40:45
without any sense of dizziness, as if we had been born to climb, we somnambulists of the
01:40:45 - 01:40:46
day.
01:40:46 - 01:40:52
We artists, we ignore what is natural, we are moonstruck and godstruck.
01:40:52 - 01:40:59
We wander still as death, unwearied, on heights that we do not see as heights but as plains,
01:40:59 - 01:41:01
as our safety.
01:41:01 - 01:41:04
Sixty
01:41:04 - 01:41:06
Women and their action at a distance.
01:41:06 - 01:41:08
Do I still have ears?
01:41:08 - 01:41:11
Am I all ears and nothing else?
01:41:11 - 01:41:15
Here I stand in the flaming surf whose white tongues are licking at my feet.
01:41:15 - 01:41:21
From all sides I hear howling, threats, screaming, roaring coming at me, while the old earthshaker
01:41:21 - 01:41:27
sings his aria in the lowest depths, deep as a bellowing bull, while pounding such an
01:41:27 - 01:41:32
earthshaking beat that the hearts of even these weather-beaten rocky monsters are trembling
01:41:32 - 01:41:33
in their bodies.
01:41:34 - 01:41:39
Then, suddenly, as if born out of nothing, there appears before the gate of this hellish
01:41:39 - 01:41:46
labyrinth, only a few fathoms away, a large sailboat gliding along as silently as a ghost.
01:41:46 - 01:41:49
Oh, what ghostly beauty!
01:41:49 - 01:41:51
How magically it touches me!
01:41:51 - 01:41:55
Has all the calm and taciturnity of the world embarked on it?
01:41:55 - 01:41:58
Does my happiness itself sit in this quiet place?
01:41:58 - 01:42:00
My happier ego?
01:42:00 - 01:42:03
My second, departed self?
01:42:03 - 01:42:06
Not to be dead and yet no longer alive.
01:42:06 - 01:42:12
A spirit-like, intermediate being, quietly observing, gliding, floating.
01:42:12 - 01:42:17
As the boat that with its white sails moves like an immense butterfly over the dark sea.
01:42:17 - 01:42:18
Yes.
01:42:18 - 01:42:20
To move over existence.
01:42:20 - 01:42:21
That's it.
01:42:21 - 01:42:23
That would be something.
01:42:23 - 01:42:27
It seems as if the noise here had led me into fantasies.
01:42:27 - 01:42:32
All great noise leads us to move happiness into some quiet distance.
01:42:32 - 01:42:37
When a man stands in the midst of his own noise, in the midst of his own surf of plans
01:42:37 - 01:42:44
and projects, then he is apt also to see quiet, magical beings gliding past him and to long
01:42:44 - 01:42:47
for their happiness and seclusion.
01:42:47 - 01:42:48
Women.
01:42:48 - 01:42:53
He almost thinks that his better self dwells there among the women and that in these quiet
01:42:53 - 01:43:01
regions even the loudest surf turns into deathly quiet and life itself into a dream about life.
01:43:01 - 01:43:02
Yet.
01:43:02 - 01:43:03
Yet.
01:43:03 - 01:43:09
Noble enthusiast, even on the most beautiful sailboat there is a lot of noise, and unfortunately
01:43:09 - 01:43:11
much small and petty noise.
01:43:11 - 01:43:16
The magic and the most powerful effect of women is, in philosophical language, action
01:43:16 - 01:43:19
at a distance, actio in distance.
01:43:19 - 01:43:25
But this requires first of all, and above all, distance.
01:43:25 - 01:43:28
Sixty-one.
01:43:28 - 01:43:32
In honor of friendship.
01:43:32 - 01:43:36
In antiquity the feeling of friendship was considered the highest feeling, even higher
01:43:36 - 01:43:42
than the most celebrated pride of the self-sufficient sage, somehow as the sole and still more sacred
01:43:42 - 01:43:44
sibling of this pride.
01:43:44 - 01:43:50
This is expressed very well in the story of the Macedonian king who gave an Athenian philosopher
01:43:50 - 01:43:55
who despised the world a talent as a present and promptly got it back.
01:43:55 - 01:43:56
How is that?
01:43:56 - 01:43:57
Asked the king.
01:43:57 - 01:43:59
Has he no friend?
01:43:59 - 01:44:05
He meant, I honor the pride of this independent sage, but I should honor his humanity even
01:44:05 - 01:44:09
more if the friend in him had triumphed over his pride.
01:44:09 - 01:44:13
The philosopher has lowered himself before me by showing that he does not know one of
01:44:13 - 01:44:18
the two highest feelings, and the higher one at that.
01:44:18 - 01:44:19
Sixty-two.
01:44:19 - 01:44:25
Love, love forgives the lover even his lust.
01:44:25 - 01:44:27
Sixty-three.
01:44:27 - 01:44:44
I am afraid that old women are more skeptical in their most secret heart of hearts than
01:44:44 - 01:44:46
any man.
01:44:46 - 01:44:51
They consider the superficiality of existence its essence, and all virtue and profundity
01:44:51 - 01:44:57
is to them merely a veil over this truth, a very welcome veil over a pudendum, in other
01:44:57 - 01:45:02
words, a matter of decency and shame, and no more than that.
01:45:02 - 01:45:03
Sixty-five.
01:45:03 - 01:45:04
Devotion.
01:45:04 - 01:45:09
There are noble women who are afflicted with a certain poverty of the spirit, and they
01:45:09 - 01:45:13
know no better way to express their deepest devotion than to offer their virtue and shame.
01:45:13 - 01:45:15
They own nothing higher.
01:45:15 - 01:45:20
Often this present is accepted without establishing as profound an obligation as the donors had
01:45:20 - 01:45:21
assumed.
01:45:21 - 01:45:24
A very melancholy story.
01:45:24 - 01:45:25
Sixty-six.
01:45:25 - 01:45:29
The strength of the weak.
01:45:29 - 01:45:32
All women are subtle in exaggerating their weaknesses.
01:45:32 - 01:45:37
They are inventive when it comes to weaknesses in order to appear as utterly fragile ornaments
01:45:37 - 01:45:40
who are hurt even by a speck of dust.
01:45:40 - 01:45:45
Their existence is supposed to make men feel clumsy and guilty on that score.
01:45:45 - 01:45:52
Thus they defend themselves against the strong and the law of the jungle.
01:45:52 - 01:45:53
Sixty-seven.
01:45:53 - 01:45:54
Simulating.
01:45:54 - 01:45:55
Oneself.
01:45:55 - 01:46:02
Now she loves him and looks ahead with quiet confidence, like a cow.
01:46:02 - 01:46:08
Alas, what bewitched him was precisely that she seemed utterly changeable and unfathomable.
01:46:08 - 01:46:11
Of steady weather he found too much in himself.
01:46:11 - 01:46:15
Can she do well to simulate her old character?
01:46:15 - 01:46:17
To simulate a lack of love?
01:46:17 - 01:46:19
Is this not the counsel of love?
01:46:19 - 01:46:22
Vivat Comoedia.
01:46:22 - 01:46:25
Or sixty-eight.
01:46:25 - 01:46:27
Will and willingness.
01:46:27 - 01:46:33
Someone took a youth to a sage and said, Look, he is being corrupted by women.
01:46:33 - 01:46:35
The sage shook his head and smiled.
01:46:35 - 01:46:41
It is men, said he, that corrupt women, and all the failings of women should be atoned
01:46:41 - 01:46:43
by and improved in men.
01:46:43 - 01:46:49
For it is man who creates for himself the image of woman, and woman forms herself according
01:46:49 - 01:46:51
to this image.
01:46:51 - 01:46:54
You are too kind-hearted about women, said one of those present.
01:46:54 - 01:46:56
You do not know them.
01:46:56 - 01:47:02
The sage replied, Will is the manner of men, willingness that of women.
01:47:02 - 01:47:06
That is the law of the sexes, truly, a hard law for women.
01:47:06 - 01:47:11
All of humanity is innocent of its existence, but women are doubly innocent.
01:47:11 - 01:47:14
Who could have oil and kindness enough for them?
01:47:14 - 01:47:15
Damn oil!
01:47:15 - 01:47:17
Damn kindness!
01:47:17 - 01:47:20
Someone else shouted out of the crowd.
01:47:20 - 01:47:22
Women need to be educated better.
01:47:22 - 01:47:27
Men need to be educated better, said the sage, and beckoned to the youth to follow him.
01:47:27 - 01:47:31
The youth, however, did not follow him.
01:47:31 - 01:47:34
Sixty-nine.
01:47:34 - 01:47:37
Capacity for revenge.
01:47:37 - 01:47:41
If someone cannot defend himself, and therefore does not want to, we do not consider this
01:47:41 - 01:47:44
a disgrace, but we have little respect for anyone who lacks both the capacity and the
01:47:44 - 01:47:50
goodwill for revenge, regardless of whether it is a man or a woman.
01:47:50 - 01:47:55
Would a woman be able to hold us, or, as they say, enthrall us, if we did not consider it
01:47:55 - 01:48:01
quite possible that under certain circumstances she could wield a dagger, any kind of dagger,
01:48:01 - 01:48:07
against us, or against herself, which in certain cases would be a crueler revenge, Chinese
01:48:07 - 01:48:09
revenge.
01:48:09 - 01:48:12
Seventy.
01:48:12 - 01:48:15
Women who master the masters.
01:48:15 - 01:48:20
A deep and powerful alto voice of the kind one sometimes hears in the theater can suddenly
01:48:20 - 01:48:24
raise the curtain upon possibilities in which we usually do not believe.
01:48:24 - 01:48:30
All at once we believe that somewhere in the world there could be women with lofty, heroic,
01:48:30 - 01:48:37
and royal souls, capable of and ready for grandiose responses, resolutions, and sacrifices,
01:48:37 - 01:48:43
capable of and ready for rule over men, because in them the best elements of man apart from
01:48:43 - 01:48:47
his sex have become an incarnate ideal.
01:48:47 - 01:48:52
The intention of the theater, to be sure, is not at all that such voices should create
01:48:52 - 01:48:54
this notion of women.
01:48:54 - 01:48:59
What they are supposed to represent is usually the ideal male lover, such as Romeo.
01:48:59 - 01:49:04
But to judge by my experience, the theater regularly miscalculates at that point, as
01:49:04 - 01:49:09
does the composer who expects that kind of effect from such a voice.
01:49:09 - 01:49:10
Such lovers are unworthy.
01:49:09 - 01:49:15
convincing. Such voices always retain some motherly and housewifely coloration, most
01:49:15 - 01:49:24
of all when they make one think of love. 71. On Female Chastity
01:49:24 - 01:49:29
There is something quite amazing and monstrous about the education of upper-class women.
01:49:29 - 01:49:34
What could be more paradoxical? All the world is agreed that they are to be brought up as
01:49:34 - 01:49:39
ignorant as possible of erotic matters, and that one has to imbue their souls with a profound
01:49:39 - 01:49:44
sense of shame in such matters, until the merest suggestion of such things triggers
01:49:44 - 01:49:50
the most extreme impatience and flight. The honor of women really comes into play only
01:49:50 - 01:49:55
here. What else would one not forgive them? But here they are supposed to remain ignorant
01:49:55 - 01:50:00
even in their hearts. They are supposed to have neither eyes nor ears, nor words nor
01:50:00 - 01:50:06
thoughts for this. They are evil, and mere knowledge is considered evil. And then to
01:50:06 - 01:50:12
be hurled, as by a gruesome lightning bolt into reality and knowledge, by marriage, precisely
01:50:12 - 01:50:19
by the man they love and esteem most. To catch love and shame in a contradiction, and to
01:50:19 - 01:50:25
be forced to experience at the same time delight, surrender, duty, pity, terror, and who knows
01:50:25 - 01:50:32
what else, in the face of the unexpected neighborliness of God and beast. Thus a psychic knot has
01:50:32 - 01:50:37
been tied that may have no equal. Even the compassionate curiosity of the wisest student
01:50:37 - 01:50:42
of humanity is inadequate for guessing how this or that woman manages to accommodate
01:50:42 - 01:50:47
herself to this solution of the riddle, and to the riddle of a solution, and what dreadful,
01:50:47 - 01:50:53
far-reaching suspicions must stir in her poor, unhinged soul, and how the ultimate philosophy
01:50:53 - 01:50:57
and skepticism of woman casts anchor at this point.
01:50:58 - 01:51:05
Afterward, the same deep silence as before. Often a silence directed at herself, too.
01:51:05 - 01:51:11
She closes her eyes to herself. Young women try hard to appear superficial and thoughtless.
01:51:11 - 01:51:17
The most refined simulate a kind of impertinence. Women easily experience their husbands as
01:51:17 - 01:51:22
a question mark concerning their honor, and their children as an apology or atonement.
01:51:22 - 01:51:27
They need children, and wish for them in a way that is altogether different from that
01:51:27 - 01:51:33
in which a man may wish for children. In sum, one cannot be too kind about women.
01:51:33 - 01:51:35
72
01:51:38 - 01:51:44
Mothers. Animals do not think about females as men do. They consider the female the productive
01:51:44 - 01:51:48
being. Paternal love does not exist among them. Merely something like love for the children
01:51:48 - 01:51:53
of a beloved, and a kind of getting used to them. The females find in their children
01:51:53 - 01:51:59
satisfaction for their desire to dominate, a possession, an occupation, something that
01:51:59 - 01:52:04
is wholly intelligible to them and can be chattered with. The sum of all this is what
01:52:04 - 01:52:10
mother love is. It is to be compared with an artist's love for his work. Pregnancy
01:52:10 - 01:52:16
has made women kinder, more patient, more timid, more pleased to submit. And just so
01:52:16 - 01:52:21
does spiritual pregnancy produce the character of the contemplative type, which is closely
01:52:21 - 01:52:27
related to the feminine character. It consists of male mothers. Among animals, the male sex
01:52:27 - 01:52:33
is considered the beautiful sex. 73
01:52:33 - 01:52:38
Holy Cruelty. A man who held a newborn child in his hands
01:52:38 - 01:52:45
approached a holy man. What shall I do with this child? he asked. It is wretched, misshapen,
01:52:45 - 01:52:51
and does not have life enough to die. Kill it, shouted the holy man with a terrible voice,
01:52:51 - 01:52:56
and then hold it in your arms for three days and three nights to create a memory for yourself.
01:52:56 - 01:53:02
Never again will you beget a child this way, when it is not time for you to beget.
01:53:02 - 01:53:07
When the man had heard this, he walked away, disappointed, and many people reproached the
01:53:07 - 01:53:13
holy man because he had counseled cruelty, for he had counseled the man to kill the child.
01:53:13 - 01:53:17
But is it not crueler to let it live? asked the holy man.
01:53:17 - 01:53:24
74 Failures.
01:53:24 - 01:53:30
Those poor women always fail, who in the presence of the man they love become restless and unsure
01:53:30 - 01:53:36
of themselves and talk too much. For what seduces men most surely is a certain secretive
01:53:36 - 01:53:38
and phlegmatic tenderness.
01:53:38 - 01:53:40
75
01:53:48 - 01:53:48
76
01:53:53 - 01:53:59
The Greatest Danger. If the majority of men had not always considered the discipline of their minds,
01:53:59 - 01:54:05
their rationality, a matter of pride, an obligation, and a virtue, feeling insulted
01:54:05 - 01:54:10
or embarrassed by all fantasies and debaucheries of thought because they saw themselves as
01:54:10 - 01:54:16
friends of healthy common sense, humanity would have perished long ago. The greatest
01:54:16 - 01:54:20
danger that always hovered over humanity, and still hovers over it, is the eruption
01:54:20 - 01:54:27
of madness, which means the eruption of arbitrariness in feeling, seeing, and hearing, the enjoyment
01:54:27 - 01:54:33
of the mind's lack of discipline, the joy in human unreason. Not truth and certainty
01:54:33 - 01:54:39
are the opposite of the world of the madman, but the universality and the universal binding
01:54:39 - 01:54:45
force of a faith, in sum, the non-arbitrary character of judgments. And man's greatest
01:54:45 - 01:54:50
labor so far has been to reach agreement about very many things and to submit to a law of
01:54:50 - 01:54:56
agreement, regardless of whether these things are true or false. This is the discipline
01:54:56 - 01:55:01
of the mind that mankind has received, but the contrary impulses are still so powerful
01:55:01 - 01:55:07
that at bottom we cannot speak of the future of mankind with much confidence. The image
01:55:07 - 01:55:12
of things still shifts and shuffles continually, and perhaps even more so and faster from now
01:55:12 - 01:55:19
on than ever before. Continually, precisely the most select spirits bristle at this universal
01:55:19 - 01:55:27
binding force, the explorers of truth above all. Continually this faith, as everybody's
01:55:27 - 01:55:34
faith, arouses nausea and a new lust in subtler minds. And the slow tempo that is here demanded
01:55:34 - 01:55:39
for all spiritual processes, this imitation of the tortoise, which is here recognized
01:55:39 - 01:55:45
as the norm, would be quite enough to turn artists and thinkers into apostates. It is
01:55:45 - 01:55:51
in these impatient spirits that a veritable delight in madness erupts because madness
01:55:51 - 01:55:57
has such a cheerful tempo. Thus the virtuous intellects are needed. Oh, let me use the
01:55:57 - 01:56:03
most unambiguous word. What is needed is virtuous stupidity, stolid metronomes for
01:56:03 - 01:56:08
the slow spirit, to make sure that the faithful of the great shared faith stay together and
01:56:08 - 01:56:15
continue their dance. It is a first-rate need that commands and demands this. We others
01:56:15 - 01:56:21
are the exception and the danger, and we need eternally to be defended. Well, there actually
01:56:21 - 01:56:26
are things to be said in favor of the exception, provided that it never wants to become the
01:56:26 - 01:56:31
rule. 77.
01:56:31 - 01:56:36
The animal with a good conscience. The vulgar element in everything that gives pleasure
01:56:36 - 01:56:42
in Southern Europe, whether it be Italian opera, for example Rossini and Bellini, or
01:56:42 - 01:56:46
the Spanish novel of adventure, most readily accessible for us in the French disguise of
01:56:46 - 01:56:52
Gil Blas, does not escape me, but it does not offend me any more than does the vulgarity
01:56:52 - 01:56:59
that one encounters as one walks through Pompeii, and, actually, also as one reads any ancient
01:56:59 - 01:57:05
book. How come? Is it because there is no sense of shame, and everything vulgar appears
01:57:05 - 01:57:10
as poised and self-assured as anything noble, lovely, and passionate in the same sort of
01:57:10 - 01:57:17
music or novel? The animal has as much right as any human being, let it run about freely,
01:57:17 - 01:57:22
and you, my dear fellow man, are also still an animal in spite of everything. That seems
01:57:22 - 01:57:28
to me to be the morale of this story and the peculiarity of Southern humanity. Bad taste
01:57:28 - 01:57:33
has its rights no less than good taste, and even a prior right, if it corresponds to a
01:57:33 - 01:57:39
great need, provides certain satisfaction and, as it were, a universal language, an
01:57:39 - 01:57:46
absolutely intelligible mask and gesture. Compared to that, good, elegant taste always
01:57:46 - 01:57:52
seems somewhat deliberate and contrived, and not altogether sure how it will be understood.
01:57:52 - 01:58:00
It never is or has been popular. What is, and remains popular, is the mask. Hence there
01:58:00 - 01:58:05
is no point in objecting to the element of masquerade in the melodies and cadenzas, in
01:58:05 - 01:58:11
the leaps and jollities that mark the rhythms of these operas. And as for ancient life,
01:58:11 - 01:58:15
what can we understand of that, as long as we do not understand the delight in masks
01:58:15 - 01:58:21
and the good conscience in using any kind of mask? Here is the bath and the recreation
01:58:21 - 01:58:26
of the ancient spirit, and perhaps the rare and sublime characters of the ancient world
01:58:26 - 01:58:32
needed this bath even more than the vulgar. A vulgar turn in Northern works, on the other
01:58:32 - 01:58:40
hand, in German music, for example, offends me unspeakably. Here there is a sense of shame.
01:58:40 - 01:58:45
The artist has lowered himself in his own eyes and could not even help blushing. We
01:58:45 - 01:58:50
are ashamed with him and feel so offended because we sense that he considered it necessary
01:58:50 - 01:58:56
to lower himself for our sake. 78
01:58:56 - 01:59:01
What Should Win Our Gratitude? Only artists, and especially those of the
01:59:01 - 01:59:05
theatre, have given men eyes and ears to see and hear with some pleasure what each man
01:59:05 - 01:59:11
is himself, experiences himself, desires himself. Only they have taught us to esteem the hero
01:59:11 - 01:59:16
that is concealed in everyday characters. Only they have taught us the art of viewing
01:59:17 - 01:59:23
ourselves as heroes, from a distance and, as it were, simplified and transfigured, the
01:59:23 - 01:59:29
art of staging and watching ourselves. Only in this way can we deal with some base details
01:59:29 - 01:59:34
in ourselves. Without this art we would be nothing but foreground and live entirely in
01:59:34 - 01:59:39
the spell of that perspective which makes what is closest at hand and most vulgar appear
01:59:39 - 01:59:45
as if it were vast and reality itself. Perhaps one should concede a similar merit to the
01:59:45 - 01:59:50
religion that made men see the sinfulness of every single individual through a magnifying
01:59:50 - 01:59:56
glass, turning the sinner into a great, immortal criminal. By surrounding him with eternal
01:59:56 - 02:00:01
perspectives, it taught man to see himself from a distance and as something past and
02:00:01 - 02:00:08
whole. 79
02:00:09 - 02:00:12
The Attraction of Imperfection
02:00:12 - 02:00:18
Here I see a poet who, like many a human being, is more attractive by virtue of his imperfections
02:00:18 - 02:00:23
than he is by all the things that grow to completion and perfection under his hands.
02:00:23 - 02:00:29
Indeed, he owes his advantages and fame much more to his ultimate incapacity than to his
02:00:29 - 02:00:34
ample strength. His works never wholly express what he would like to express and what he
02:00:34 - 02:00:40
would like to have seen. It seems as if he had had the foretaste of a vision and never
02:00:40 - 02:00:46
the vision itself. But a tremendous lust for this vision remains in his soul, and it is
02:00:46 - 02:00:51
from this that he derives his equally tremendous eloquence of desire and craving. By virtue
02:00:51 - 02:00:57
of this lust, he lifts his listeners above his work and all mere works and lends them
02:00:57 - 02:01:03
wings to soar as high as listeners had never soared. Then, having themselves been transformed
02:01:03 - 02:01:09
into poets and seers, they lavish admiration upon the creator of their happiness, as if
02:01:09 - 02:01:14
he had led them immediately to the vision of what was for him the holiest and ultimate,
02:01:14 - 02:01:20
as if he had attained his goal and had really seen and communicated his vision. His fame
02:01:20 - 02:01:25
benefits from the fact that he never reached his goal.
02:01:25 - 02:01:30
80 Art and Nature
02:01:30 - 02:01:35
The Greeks, or at least the Athenians, liked to hear people speak well. Nothing distinguishes
02:01:35 - 02:01:40
them so thoroughly from non-Greeks as does this truly greedy craving. Even of passion
02:01:40 - 02:01:45
on the stage they demanded that it should speak well, and they endured the unnaturalness
02:01:45 - 02:01:52
of dramatic verse with rapture. In nature, passion is so poor in words, so embarrassed
02:01:52 - 02:01:58
and all but mute, or when it finds words, so confused and irrational and ashamed of
02:01:58 - 02:02:03
itself. Thanks to the Greeks, all of us have now become accustomed to this unnatural stage
02:02:03 - 02:02:09
convention just as we tolerate, and tolerate gladly, thanks to the Italians, that other
02:02:09 - 02:02:15
unnatural convention, passion that sings. We have developed a need that we cannot satisfy
02:02:15 - 02:02:22
in reality. To hear people in the most difficult situations speak well and at length, we are
02:02:22 - 02:02:28
delighted when the tragic hero still finds words, reasons, eloquent gestures, and altogether
02:02:28 - 02:02:33
intellectual brightness, where life approaches abysses and men in reality usually lose their
02:02:33 - 02:02:39
heads and certainly linguistic felicity. This kind of deviation from nature is perhaps
02:02:39 - 02:02:46
the most agreeable repast for human pride. For its sake, man loves art as the expression
02:02:46 - 02:02:52
of a lofty, heroic unnaturalness and convention. We rightly reproach a dramatic poet if he
02:02:52 - 02:02:57
does not transmute everything into reason and words, but always retains in his hands
02:02:57 - 02:03:03
a residue of silence, just as we are dissatisfied with the operatic composer who cannot find
02:03:03 - 02:03:10
melodies for the highest sentiments, but only a sentimental natural, stammering and screaming.
02:03:11 - 02:03:17
At this point, nature is supposed to be contradicted. Here the vulgar attraction of illusion is
02:03:17 - 02:03:24
supposed to give way to a higher attraction. The Greeks went far, very far in this respect,
02:03:24 - 02:03:29
alarmingly far, just as they made the stage as narrow as possible and denied themselves
02:03:29 - 02:03:35
any effects by means of deep backgrounds, just as they made facial expressions and easy
02:03:35 - 02:03:42
movements impossible for the actor and transformed him into a solemn, stiff, masked bogey. They
02:03:42 - 02:03:49
also deprived passion itself of any deep background and dictated to it a law of beautiful speeches.
02:03:49 - 02:03:54
Indeed, they did everything to counteract the elementary effect of images that might
02:03:54 - 02:04:00
arouse fear and pity, for they did not want fear and pity. Giving all honor and the highest
02:04:00 - 02:04:06
honors to Aristotle, he certainly did not hit the nail, much less on the head, when
02:04:06 - 02:04:11
he discussed the ultimate end of Greek tragedy. Just look at the Greek tragic poets to see
02:04:11 - 02:04:18
what it was that most excited their industry, their inventiveness, their competition, certainly
02:04:18 - 02:04:22
not the attempt to overwhelm the spectator with sentiments.
02:04:22 - 02:04:26
The Athenian went to the theater in order to hear beautiful speeches, and beautiful
02:04:26 - 02:04:32
speeches were what concerned Sophocles. Pardon this heresy. It is very different with serious
02:04:32 - 02:04:38
opera. All of its masters take pains to prevent anyone from understanding their characters.
02:04:38 - 02:04:42
Certainly picking up a word must help the inattentive listener, but on the whole the
02:04:42 - 02:04:49
situation must explain itself, and the speeches do not matter. That is what all of them think,
02:04:49 - 02:04:53
and hence they have their fun with the words. Perhaps they merely lacked the courage to
02:04:53 - 02:04:59
express fully their ultimate lack of regard for words. With just a little more impertinence,
02:04:59 - 02:05:04
Rossini would have had everybody sing nothing but la, la, la, la, and that would have made
02:05:04 - 02:05:10
good rational sense. Confronted with the characters in an opera, we are not supposed
02:05:10 - 02:05:16
to take their word for it but the sound. That is the difference. That is the beautiful unnaturalness
02:05:16 - 02:05:22
for whose sake one goes to the opera. Even the recitativo secco really is not meant to
02:05:22 - 02:05:28
be heard as words and text. This kind of half music is only supposed, first, to give the
02:05:28 - 02:05:34
musical ear a little rest, rest from the melody as the most sublime but therefore also most
02:05:34 - 02:05:41
strenuous enjoyment of this art, and then very soon also something else, namely, a growing
02:05:41 - 02:05:48
impatience, a growing irritation, a new desire for whole music, for melodies. How are things
02:05:48 - 02:05:55
with Richard Wagner's art when we consider it in this perspective? Different perhaps?
02:05:55 - 02:05:59
Often it has seemed to me as if one had to memorize the words and the music of his creations
02:06:00 - 02:06:05
before the performance. Otherwise it seemed to me one heard neither the words nor even
02:06:05 - 02:06:10
the music. 81. Greek taste.
02:06:10 - 02:06:18
What is beautiful in it? asked the surveyor after a performance of Iphigenia. Nothing is
02:06:18 - 02:06:24
proved in it. Were the Greeks really so far from sharing this taste? In Sophocles, at any rate,
02:06:24 - 02:06:31
everything is proved. 82. Esprit as un-Greek.
02:06:31 - 02:06:38
The Greeks were exceedingly logical and plain in all of their thinking. They never wearied of that,
02:06:38 - 02:06:42
at least during their long good period, as the French so often do, who just love to take a
02:06:42 - 02:06:48
little leap into the opposite, and really can endure the spirit of logic only if, owing to a
02:06:48 - 02:06:53
lot of such little leaps into the opposite, it betrays its sociable readiness for pleasantry,
02:06:53 - 02:07:00
its sociable self-denial. Logic they considered necessary, like bread and water, but also,
02:07:00 - 02:07:06
like these, as the kind of nourishment that is fit for prisoners if it is to be taken straight
02:07:06 - 02:07:12
with nothing added. In good society, one must never wish to be solely and entirely right,
02:07:12 - 02:07:19
which is what all pure logic aims at. Hence the small dose of unreason in all French esprit.
02:07:19 - 02:07:24
The sociability of the Greeks was far less developed than that of the French has been,
02:07:24 - 02:07:30
and still is. That is why we find so little esprit even in their most spirited men,
02:07:30 - 02:07:36
so little wit even in their wittiest men, and, alas, even these sentences will meet with disbelief,
02:07:36 - 02:07:43
and how many more of that sort I am tempted to add. Est res magnitacere, said Marshall,
02:07:43 - 02:07:50
like all garrulous people. 83. Translations.
02:07:50 - 02:07:56
The degree of the historical sense of any age may be inferred from the manner in which this age
02:07:56 - 02:08:02
makes translations, and tries to absorb former ages and books. In the age of Cornet, and even
02:08:02 - 02:08:08
of the Revolution, the French took possession of Roman antiquity in a way for which we would
02:08:08 - 02:08:14
longer have courage enough, thanks to our more highly developed historical sense. And Roman
02:08:14 - 02:08:20
antiquity itself, how forcibly and at the same time how naively it took hold of everything good
02:08:20 - 02:08:26
and lofty of Greek antiquity, which was more ancient. How they translated things into the
02:08:26 - 02:08:31
Roman present, how deliberately and recklessly they brushed the dust off the wings of the
02:08:31 - 02:08:38
butterfly that is called moment. Thus Horace now and then translated Alcaeus or Archilochus,
02:08:38 - 02:08:44
and Propertius did the same with Callimachus and Philetus, poets of the same rank as Theocritus,
02:08:44 - 02:08:50
if we may judge. What was it to them that the real Creator had experienced this and that,
02:08:50 - 02:08:56
and written the signs of it into his poem? As poets they had no sympathy for the antiquarian
02:08:56 - 02:09:01
inquisitiveness that precedes the historical sense. As poets they had no time for all those
02:09:01 - 02:09:06
very personal things and names and whatever might be considered the costume and mask of a city,
02:09:06 - 02:09:14
a coast, or a century. Quickly they replaced it with what was contemporary and Roman. They seem
02:09:14 - 02:09:20
to ask us, should we not make new for ourselves what is old and find ourselves in it? Should we
02:09:20 - 02:09:26
not have the right to breathe our own soul into this dead body? For it is dead after all. How
02:09:26 - 02:09:32
ugly is everything dead? They did not know the delights of the historical sense. What was past
02:09:32 - 02:09:38
and alien was an embarrassment for them, and being romance, they saw it as an incentive for a Roman
02:09:38 - 02:09:46
conquest. Indeed, translation was a form of conquest. Not only did one omit what was historical,
02:09:46 - 02:09:52
one also added allusions to the present, and above all struck out the name of the poet and
02:09:52 - 02:09:57
replaced it with one's own, not with any sense of theft, but with the very best conscience of
02:09:57 - 02:10:08
the Imperium Romanum. 84. On the origin of poetry. Those who love the fantastic side of man and at
02:10:08 - 02:10:14
the same time champion the notion of instinctive morality argue as follows. If we assumed that
02:10:14 - 02:10:19
utility had always been venerated as the supreme deity, how could we possibly account for poetry?
02:10:20 - 02:10:26
After all, this rhythmic speech does anything but promote the clarity of communication, and yet it
02:10:26 - 02:10:32
has shot up all over the earth and still does, as if it meant to mock expediency and utility. The
02:10:32 - 02:10:39
wild and beautiful irrationality of poetry refutes your utilitarianism. It was precisely the desire
02:10:39 - 02:10:45
to get away from utility for once that elevated man and furnish the inspiration for morality and
02:10:45 - 02:10:52
art. Well, in this case I have to side with the utilitarians. After all, they are right so rarely
02:10:52 - 02:10:58
that it is really pitiful. In those ancient times in which poetry came into existence, the aim was
02:10:58 - 02:10:59
utility.
02:10:59 - 02:11:02
and actually a very great utility.
02:11:02 - 02:11:07
When one lets rhythm permeate speech, the rhythmic force that reorders all the atoms
02:11:07 - 02:11:13
of a sentence bids one choose one's words with case and gives one's thoughts a new
02:11:13 - 02:11:18
color, making them darker, stranger, and more remote.
02:11:18 - 02:11:22
The utility in question was superstitious.
02:11:22 - 02:11:26
Rhythm was meant to impress the gods more deeply with a human petition, for it was noticed
02:11:26 - 02:11:30
that men remember a verse much better than ordinary speech.
02:11:30 - 02:11:35
It was also believed that a rhythmic tick-tock was audible over greater distances, a rhythmical
02:11:35 - 02:11:40
prayer was supposed to get closer to the ears of the gods.
02:11:40 - 02:11:45
Above all, men desired the utility of the elemental and overpowering effect that we
02:11:45 - 02:11:48
experience in ourselves as we listen to music.
02:11:48 - 02:11:50
Rhythm is a compulsion.
02:11:50 - 02:11:53
It engenders an unconquerable urge to yield and join in.
02:11:54 - 02:12:00
Not only our feet follow the beat, but the soul does too, probably, one surmised, the
02:12:00 - 02:12:02
soul of the gods as well.
02:12:02 - 02:12:07
Thus one tried to compel the gods by using rhythm and to force their hand.
02:12:07 - 02:12:11
Poetry was thrown at them like a magical snare.
02:12:11 - 02:12:15
There was an even stranger notion that may have contributed most of all to the origin
02:12:15 - 02:12:17
of poetry.
02:12:17 - 02:12:24
Among the Pythagoreans, it appears as a philosophical doctrine and an artifice in education.
02:12:24 - 02:12:28
But long before there were any philosophers, music was credited with the power of discharging
02:12:28 - 02:12:35
the emotions, of purifying the soul, of easing the ferocia animae.
02:12:35 - 02:12:37
Precisely by means of rhythm.
02:12:37 - 02:12:42
When the proper tension and harmony of the soul had been lost, one had to dance, following
02:12:42 - 02:12:44
the singer's beat.
02:12:44 - 02:12:47
That was the prescription of this therapy.
02:12:47 - 02:12:52
That is how Terpander put an end to a riot, how Empedocles soothed a raging maniac, and
02:12:52 - 02:12:57
how Daemon purified a youth who was pining away, being in love.
02:12:57 - 02:13:02
And this was also the cure one tried to apply to the gods when the desire for revenge had
02:13:02 - 02:13:04
made them rabid.
02:13:04 - 02:13:09
Above all, one suit to push the exuberance and giddiness of the emotions to the ultimate
02:13:09 - 02:13:15
extreme, making those who were in a rage entirely mad, and the Vengeful, frenzied with lust
02:13:15 - 02:13:17
for revenge.
02:13:17 - 02:13:22
All orgiastic cults aim at discharging the ferocia of some deity all at once, turning
02:13:22 - 02:13:27
it into an orgy, in order that the deity should feel freer and calmer afterward, and leave
02:13:27 - 02:13:29
man in peace.
02:13:29 - 02:13:33
Etymologically, Melos is a tranquilizer, not because it is tranquil itself, but because
02:13:33 - 02:13:36
its after-effects make one tranquil.
02:13:36 - 02:13:42
It is not only in the cult song, but also in worldly songs of the most ancient times,
02:13:42 - 02:13:46
that it is assumed that rhythm has a magical power.
02:13:46 - 02:13:51
As one draws water or rose, for example, a song is supposed to cast a spell over the
02:13:51 - 02:13:54
daemons that one imagines at work in such cases.
02:13:54 - 02:14:00
It makes them pliant and unfree, so that they become man's instruments.
02:14:00 - 02:14:04
Every action provides an occasion for song, every action depends on the assistance of
02:14:04 - 02:14:11
spirits, and the magical song and the spell seem to be the primal form of poetry.
02:14:11 - 02:14:13
Verse also had a function in oracles.
02:14:13 - 02:14:18
The Greeks claimed that the hexameter was invented at Delphi, because here, too, rhythm
02:14:18 - 02:14:21
was supposed to affect a compulsion.
02:14:21 - 02:14:26
Asking for a prophecy meant originally, according to the etymology of the word that seems most
02:14:26 - 02:14:31
probable to me, to get something determined, one thought that one could compel the future
02:14:31 - 02:14:38
by gaining the favor of Apollo, who was originally taken to be much more than a prescient god.
02:14:38 - 02:14:44
As the formula is pronounced with literal and rhythmical precision, it binds the future.
02:14:44 - 02:14:50
But the formula is the invention of Apollo, who, being the god of rhythm, can bind even
02:14:50 - 02:14:52
the goddesses of fate.
02:14:52 - 02:14:58
In sum, what could have been more useful for the ancient, superstitious type of man than
02:14:58 - 02:14:59
rhythm?
02:14:59 - 02:15:05
It enabled one to do anything, to advance some work magically, to force a god to appear,
02:15:05 - 02:15:11
to be near, and to listen, to mold the future in accordance with one's will, to cleanse
02:15:11 - 02:15:17
one's own soul from some excess of anxiety, mania, pity, or vengefulness, and not only
02:15:17 - 02:15:21
one's own soul but also that of the most evil demon.
02:15:21 - 02:15:27
Without verse one was nothing, by means of verse one almost became a god.
02:15:27 - 02:15:33
Such a fundamental feeling can never be erased entirely, and even now, after men have fought
02:15:33 - 02:15:38
against such superstitions for thousands of years, the wisest among us are still occasionally
02:15:38 - 02:15:45
fooled by rhythm, if only insofar as we sometimes consider an idea truer simply because it has
02:15:45 - 02:15:50
a metrical form and presents itself with a divine skip and jump.
02:15:50 - 02:15:55
Isn't it rather amusing that to this day the most serious philosophers, however strict
02:15:55 - 02:16:01
they may be in questions of certainty, still call on what poets have said in order to lend
02:16:01 - 02:16:04
their ideas force and credibility?
02:16:04 - 02:16:10
And yet it is more dangerous for a truth when a poet agrees than when he contradicts it,
02:16:10 - 02:16:14
for as Homer says, many lies tell the poets.
02:16:14 - 02:16:17
85
02:16:17 - 02:16:19
The Good and the Beautiful
02:16:19 - 02:16:24
Artists continually glorify, they do nothing else, all those states and things that are
02:16:24 - 02:16:29
reputed to give man the opportunity to feel good for once, or great, or intoxicated, or
02:16:29 - 02:16:33
cheerful, or well and wise.
02:16:33 - 02:16:37
These select things and states whose value for human happiness is considered safe and
02:16:37 - 02:16:41
assured are the artist's objects.
02:16:41 - 02:16:47
Artists always lie in wait to discover such objects and draw them into the realm of art.
02:16:47 - 02:16:51
What I mean is that they are not themselves the appraisers of happiness, rather they try
02:16:51 - 02:16:56
to get close to those who make the appraisals with the utmost curiosity and the urge to
02:16:56 - 02:17:00
utilize these appraisals immediately.
02:17:00 - 02:17:04
Since they have in addition to this impatience also the big lungs of heralds and the feet
02:17:04 - 02:17:11
of runners, they are also always among the first to glorify the new good, and they therefore
02:17:11 - 02:17:15
appear to be the first to call it good, to appraise it as good.
02:17:15 - 02:17:19
But this is, as I have said, an error.
02:17:19 - 02:17:23
They are merely quicker and louder than the real appraisers.
02:17:23 - 02:17:25
But who are the real appraisers?
02:17:25 - 02:17:28
The rich and the idle.
02:17:28 - 02:17:32
86.
02:17:32 - 02:17:35
Of the Theater.
02:17:35 - 02:17:40
I had strong and elevated feelings again today, and if I could have music and art in the evening
02:17:40 - 02:17:45
I know very well what sort of music and art I do not want, namely the kind that tries
02:17:45 - 02:17:50
to intoxicate the audience and to force it to the height of a moment of strong and elevated
02:17:50 - 02:17:52
feelings.
02:17:52 - 02:17:57
This kind is designed for those everyday souls who in the evening are not like victors on
02:17:57 - 02:18:01
their triumphal chariots, but rather like tired mules who have been whipped too much
02:18:01 - 02:18:03
by life.
02:18:03 - 02:18:09
What would men of this type know of higher moods if there were no intoxicants and idealistic
02:18:09 - 02:18:10
whips?
02:18:10 - 02:18:14
Hence, they have those who enthuse them even as they have their wines.
02:18:14 - 02:18:18
But what are their drinks and their intoxication to me?
02:18:18 - 02:18:22
Does he that is enthusiastic need wine?
02:18:22 - 02:18:26
Rather he looks with some sort of nausea at the means and mediators that are trying to
02:18:26 - 02:18:33
produce an effect without a sufficient reason, aping the high tide of the soul.
02:18:33 - 02:18:34
What now?
02:18:34 - 02:18:39
One gives the mole wings and proud conceits, before it is time to go to sleep, before he
02:18:39 - 02:18:42
crawls back into his hole.
02:18:42 - 02:18:47
One sends him off into the theater and places large glasses before his blind and tired eyes.
02:18:47 - 02:18:54
Men whose lives are not an action, but a business, sit before the stage and observe strange creatures
02:18:54 - 02:18:57
for whom life is no mere business.
02:18:57 - 02:19:01
That is decent, you say, that is entertaining, that is culture.
02:19:01 - 02:19:07
Well in that case I often lack culture, for much of the time I find this spectacle nauseous.
02:19:07 - 02:19:13
Whoever finds enough tragedy and comedy in himself probably does best when he stays away
02:19:13 - 02:19:17
from the theater, or if he makes an exception, the whole process, including the theater,
02:19:17 - 02:19:23
the audience, and the poet, will strike him as the really tragic or comical spectacle,
02:19:23 - 02:19:30
while the play that is performed will mean very little to him by comparison.
02:19:30 - 02:19:36
What are the Fausts and Manfreds of the theater to anyone who is somewhat like Faust and Manfred?
02:19:36 - 02:19:39
But it may give him something to think about that characters of that type should ever be
02:19:39 - 02:19:41
brought upon the stage.
02:19:41 - 02:19:47
The strongest ideas and passions brought before those who are not capable of ideas and passions,
02:19:47 - 02:19:49
but only of intoxication.
02:19:49 - 02:19:54
And here they are employed as a means to produce intoxication.
02:19:54 - 02:19:59
Theater and music as the hashish smoking and beetle chewing of the European.
02:19:59 - 02:20:02
Who will ever relate the whole history of narcotica?
02:20:02 - 02:20:08
It is almost the history of culture, of our so-called higher culture.
02:20:08 - 02:20:11
87.
02:20:11 - 02:20:14
Of the Vanity of Artists.
02:20:14 - 02:20:20
I believe that artists often do not know what they can do best because they are too vain
02:20:20 - 02:20:24
and have fixed their minds on something prouder than those small plants seem to be that really
02:20:24 - 02:20:30
can grow on their soil to perfection and are new, strange, and beautiful.
02:20:30 - 02:20:34
They do not think much of what is actually good in their own garden or vineyard, and
02:20:34 - 02:20:38
their love and insight are not of the same order.
02:20:38 - 02:20:42
Here is a musician who, more than any other musician, is a master at discovering the tones
02:20:42 - 02:20:48
out of the realm of suffering, depressed, tormented souls, and at giving speech even
02:20:48 - 02:20:50
to dumb animals.
02:20:50 - 02:20:55
Nobody equals him in the colors of late fall, the indescribably moving happiness of the
02:20:55 - 02:21:00
last, very last, very briefest enjoyment.
02:21:00 - 02:21:05
He finds sounds for those secret and uncanny midnights of the soul, in which cause and
02:21:05 - 02:21:11
effect appear to be unhinged, and any moment something can come into being out of nothing.
02:21:11 - 02:21:16
More happily than anyone else, he draws from the very bottom of human happiness, as it
02:21:16 - 02:21:22
were, from its drained cup, where the bitterest and most repulsive drops have merged in the
02:21:22 - 02:21:26
end, for better or for worse, with the sweetest.
02:21:26 - 02:21:32
He knows how souls drag themselves along when they can no longer leap and fly nor even walk.
02:21:32 - 02:21:37
His is the shy glance of concealed pain, of understanding without comfort, of farewells
02:21:37 - 02:21:39
without confessions.
02:21:39 - 02:21:45
As the Orpheus of all secret misery, he is greater than anyone, and he has incorporated
02:21:45 - 02:21:51
in art some things that had previously seemed to be inexpressible and even unworthy of art,
02:21:51 - 02:21:55
as if words could only frighten them away, not grasp them.
02:21:55 - 02:22:02
Very small, microscopic features of the soul, yes, he is the master of the very small.
02:22:02 - 02:22:05
But that is not what he wants to be.
02:22:05 - 02:22:09
His character prefers large walls and audacious frescoes.
02:22:09 - 02:22:14
He fails to see that his spirit has a different taste and urge, and likes best of all to sit
02:22:14 - 02:22:21
quietly in the nooks of houses that have collapsed, there, concealed, concealed from himself.
02:22:21 - 02:22:26
He paints his real masterpieces, all of which are very short, often only a single measure
02:22:26 - 02:22:27
in length.
02:22:27 - 02:22:33
There he becomes wholly good, great, and perfect, perhaps only there.
02:22:33 - 02:22:35
But he does not know it.
02:22:35 - 02:22:38
He is too vain to know it.
02:22:38 - 02:22:40
88.
02:22:40 - 02:22:42
Being serious about truth.
02:22:42 - 02:22:44
Being serious about truth.
02:22:44 - 02:22:48
What very different ideas people associate with these words.
02:22:48 - 02:22:53
The very same views and types of proof and scrutiny that a thinker may consider a frivolity
02:22:53 - 02:22:58
in himself, to which he has succumbed on this or that occasion to his shame.
02:22:58 - 02:23:02
These very same views may give an artist who encounters them and lives with them for a
02:23:02 - 02:23:08
while the feeling that he has now become deeply serious about truth, and that it is admirable
02:23:08 - 02:23:14
how he, although an artist, has at the same time the most serious desire for the opposite
02:23:14 - 02:23:16
of mere appearance.
02:23:16 - 02:23:22
Thus it can happen that a man's emphatic seriousness shows how superficial and modest his spirit
02:23:22 - 02:23:26
has been all along when playing with knowledge.
02:23:26 - 02:23:29
And does not everything that we take seriously betray us?
02:23:29 - 02:23:34
It always shows what has weight for us and what does not.
02:23:34 - 02:23:37
89.
02:23:37 - 02:23:39
Now and formerly.
02:23:39 - 02:23:45
What good is all the art of our works of art if we lose that higher art, the art of festivals?
02:23:45 - 02:23:51
Previously all works of art adorned the great festival road of humanity to commemorate high
02:23:51 - 02:23:53
and happy moments.
02:23:53 - 02:23:58
Now one uses works of art to lure aside from the great via dolorosa of humanity those who
02:23:58 - 02:24:04
are wretched, exhausted, and sick, and to offer them a brief lustful moment, a little
02:24:04 - 02:24:07
intoxication and madness.
02:24:07 - 02:24:09
90.
02:24:09 - 02:24:11
Lights and shadows.
02:24:11 - 02:24:15
Lights and drafts mean something quite different for different thinkers.
02:24:15 - 02:24:19
One collects in a book the lights that he has been able to steal and carry home swiftly
02:24:19 - 02:24:24
out of the rays of some insight that suddenly dawned on him, while another thinker offers
02:24:24 - 02:24:30
us nothing but shadows, images in black and gray, of what had built up in his soul the
02:24:30 - 02:24:32
day before.
02:24:32 - 02:24:35
91.
02:24:35 - 02:24:38
Caution.
02:24:38 - 02:24:43
As is well known, Alfieri told a great many lies when he told his surprise contemporaries
02:24:43 - 02:24:45
the story of his life.
02:24:45 - 02:24:51
What prompted these lies was the same despotic attitude toward himself that he also manifested
02:24:51 - 02:24:56
in the way in which he created his own language and tyrannically forced himself to become
02:24:56 - 02:24:57
a poet.
02:24:57 - 02:25:02
He had finally found a severe form of sublimity into which he then pressed his life and his
02:25:02 - 02:25:04
memory.
02:25:04 - 02:25:07
No doubt there was much agony in all of this.
02:25:07 - 02:25:13
I also would not believe a biography of Plato written by himself, any more than Rousseau's,
02:25:13 - 02:25:17
or the Vita Nuova of Dante.
02:25:17 - 02:25:19
92.
02:25:19 - 02:25:20
Prose and poetry.
02:25:20 - 02:25:25
It is noteworthy that the great masters of prose have almost always been poets too, if
02:25:25 - 02:25:29
not publicly then at least secretly, in the closet.
02:25:29 - 02:25:35
Good prose is written only face to face with poetry, for it is an uninterrupted, well-mannered
02:25:35 - 02:25:36
war with poetry.
02:25:36 - 02:25:43
All of its attractions depend on the way in which poetry is continually avoided and contradicted.
02:25:43 - 02:25:48
Everything abstract wants to be read as a prank against poetry, and as with a mocking
02:25:48 - 02:25:50
voice.
02:25:50 - 02:25:56
Everything dry and cool is meant to drive the lovely goddess into lovely despair.
02:25:56 - 02:26:01
Often there are reproachments, reconciliations for a moment, and then a sudden leap back
02:26:01 - 02:26:03
and laughter.
02:26:03 - 02:26:07
Often the curtain is raised and harsh light let in just as the goddess is enjoying her
02:26:07 - 02:26:10
dusks and muted colors.
02:26:10 - 02:26:14
Often the words are taken out of her mouth and sung to a tune that drives her to cover
02:26:14 - 02:26:18
her refined ears with her refined hands.
02:26:18 - 02:26:23
Thus there are thousands of delights in this war, including the defeats of which the unpoetic
02:26:23 - 02:26:27
souls, the so-called prose men, do not know a thing.
02:26:27 - 02:26:31
Hence they write and speak only bad prose.
02:26:31 - 02:26:33
War is the father of all good things.
02:26:33 - 02:26:37
War is also the father of good prose.
02:26:37 - 02:26:43
Four very strange and truly poetic human beings in this century have attained mastery in prose,
02:26:43 - 02:26:49
for which this century was not made otherwise, for lack of poetry, as I have suggested.
02:26:49 - 02:26:54
Not including Goethe, who may fairly be claimed by the century that produced him, I regard
02:26:54 - 02:27:02
only Giacomo Leopardi, Prosper Mérimée, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Walter Savage Landor,
02:27:02 - 02:27:09
the author of Imaginary Conversations, as worthy of being called masters of prose.
02:27:09 - 02:27:11
93.
02:27:11 - 02:27:12
But why do you write?
02:27:12 - 02:27:18
A. I am not one of those who think with an inky pen in their hand, much less one of those
02:27:18 - 02:27:23
who in front of an open inkwell abandon themselves to their passions while they sit in a chair
02:27:23 - 02:27:25
and stare at the paper.
02:27:25 - 02:27:28
I am annoyed by and ashamed of my writing.
02:27:28 - 02:27:33
Writing is for me a pressing and embarrassing need, and to speak of it even in a parable
02:27:33 - 02:27:35
disgusts me.
02:27:35 - 02:27:38
B. But why then do you write?
02:27:38 - 02:27:44
A. Well, my friend, to be quite frank, so far I have not discovered any other way of
02:27:44 - 02:27:46
getting rid of my thoughts.
02:27:46 - 02:27:49
B. And why do you want to get rid of them?
02:27:49 - 02:27:51
A. Why I want to.
02:27:51 - 02:27:52
Do I want to?
02:27:52 - 02:27:53
I must.
02:27:53 - 02:27:57
B. Enough, enough.
02:27:57 - 02:28:01
94.
02:28:01 - 02:28:04
Growth After Death
02:28:04 - 02:28:08
Those audacious little words about moral questions that Fontenelle threw out in his Immortal
02:28:08 - 02:28:13
Dialogues of the Dead were considered in his own time as mere paradoxes and games of a
02:28:13 - 02:28:16
not inconsiderable wit.
02:28:16 - 02:28:21
Even the highest arbiters of taste and spirit found nothing more here, and perhaps Fontenelle
02:28:21 - 02:28:24
himself did not.
02:28:24 - 02:28:26
Now something incredible happens.
02:28:26 - 02:28:29
These thoughts become realities.
02:28:29 - 02:28:30
Science proves them.
02:28:30 - 02:28:32
The game becomes serious.
02:28:32 - 02:28:36
And now we read these dialogues with very different feelings than Voltaire and Helvetius
02:28:36 - 02:28:41
did, and automatically we promote their author to another, much higher rank in the hierarchy
02:28:41 - 02:28:46
of spirits, rightly or wrongly.
02:28:46 - 02:28:48
95.
02:28:48 - 02:28:54
Champfort That a man who understood men, and the crowd
02:28:54 - 02:28:59
as well as Champfort, nevertheless joined the crowd and did not stay aside in philosophical
02:28:59 - 02:29:04
renunciation and resistance, I can explain to myself only in this way.
02:29:04 - 02:29:10
He had one instinct that was even stronger than his wisdom, and had never been satisfied—hatred
02:29:10 - 02:29:13
of all nobility—by blood.
02:29:13 - 02:29:17
Perhaps it was the old hatred felt by his mother that was only too easy to explain and
02:29:17 - 02:29:22
had been sanctified by him through his love for her, an instinct of revenge that went
02:29:22 - 02:29:26
back to his boyhood and waited for the hour to revenge his mother.
02:29:26 - 02:29:32
And now life and his genius, and no doubt most of all the paternal blood in his veins,
02:29:32 - 02:29:38
had seduced him to join the ranks of this nobility as an école for many, many years.
02:29:38 - 02:29:43
Eventually, however, he could no longer endure the sight of himself, the sight of the old
02:29:43 - 02:29:45
type under the old regime.
02:29:45 - 02:29:50
He became repentant with a violent passion, and this led him to put on the clothes of
02:29:50 - 02:29:53
the mob as his kind of hair shirt.
02:29:53 - 02:29:56
He had a bad conscience because he had not taken revenge.
02:29:56 - 02:30:00
Had Champfort remained just a little more of a philosopher, the revolution would have
02:30:00 - 02:30:04
missed out on its tragic wit and its sharpest sting.
02:30:04 - 02:30:10
It would be regarded as a much more stupid event and would not seduce so many spirits.
02:30:10 - 02:30:15
But the hatred and revenge of Champfort educated a whole generation, and the most illustrious
02:30:15 - 02:30:19
human beings passed through this school.
02:30:19 - 02:30:23
Note that Mirabeau looked up to Champfort as to his higher and older self from which
02:30:23 - 02:30:30
he expected and accepted impulses, warnings, and verdicts, Mirabeau who as a human being
02:30:30 - 02:30:34
belongs to an altogether different order of greatness than even the foremost statesman
02:30:34 - 02:30:37
of yesterday and today.
02:30:37 - 02:30:42
It is odd that despite such a friend and advocate, after all, we have Mirabeau's letters
02:30:42 - 02:30:48
to Champfort, this wittiest of all moralists has remained a stranger to the French, no
02:30:48 - 02:30:53
less than Stendhal who may well have had more thoughtful eyes and ears than any other Frenchman
02:30:53 - 02:30:55
of this century.
02:30:55 - 02:31:00
Is that because the latter had too many German and English traits to be tolerable for Parisians?
02:31:00 - 02:31:07
While Champfort, a man who was rich in depths and backgrounds of the soul, gloomy, suffering,
02:31:07 - 02:31:12
ardent, a thinker who needed laughter as a remedy against life and who almost considered
02:31:12 - 02:31:17
himself lost on every day on which he had not laughed, seems much more like an Italian
02:31:17 - 02:31:22
related to Dante and Leopardi than like a Frenchman.
02:31:22 - 02:31:28
We know the last words of Champfort, Ah, mon ami, he said to Sieyès, je m'en vais enfin
02:31:28 - 02:31:33
de ce monde où il faut que le coeur se brise ou se bronze.
02:31:33 - 02:31:36
These are surely not the words of a dying Frenchman.
02:31:36 - 02:31:41
96 Two Speakers
02:31:41 - 02:31:46
Of these two speakers, one can show the full rationality of his cause only when he abandons
02:31:46 - 02:31:48
himself to passion.
02:31:48 - 02:31:52
This alone pumps enough blood and heat into his brain to force his high spirituality to
02:31:52 - 02:31:54
reveal itself.
02:31:54 - 02:32:00
The other one may try the same now and then, to present his cause sonorously, vehemently,
02:32:00 - 02:32:05
and to sweep his audience off their feet with the help of passion, but usually with little
02:32:05 - 02:32:06
success.
02:32:06 - 02:32:12
Soon he speaks obscurely and confusedly, he exaggerates, he omits things, and he arouses
02:32:12 - 02:32:16
mistrust about the rationality of his cause.
02:32:16 - 02:32:21
Actually he himself comes to feel mistrust, and that explains sudden leaps into the coldest
02:32:21 - 02:32:27
and most repugnant tones that lead his audience to doubt whether his passion was genuine.
02:32:27 - 02:32:32
In his case, passion always inundates the spirit perhaps because it is stronger than
02:32:32 - 02:32:37
in the first speaker, but he is at the height of his powers when he resists the flood of
02:32:37 - 02:32:40
his emotions and virtually derides it.
02:32:40 - 02:32:46
Only then does his spirit emerge fully from its hiding place, a logical, mocking, playful,
02:32:46 - 02:32:49
and yet awesome spirit.
02:32:49 - 02:32:49
97
02:32:49 - 02:32:57
Of the garrulousness of writers, there is a garrulousness of wrath, frequently encountered
02:32:57 - 02:33:03
in Luther as well as Schopenhauer, a garrulousness due to a superabundant supply of conceptual
02:33:03 - 02:33:10
formulations as in Kant, a garrulousness due to the delight in ever new twists of the same
02:33:10 - 02:33:16
thing to be found in Montaigne, a garrulousness of spiteful characters.
02:33:16 - 02:33:22
Anyone who reads contemporary publications will recall two writers of this type, a garrulousness
02:33:22 - 02:33:28
due to the delight in good words and language forms, not at all rare in Goethe's prose,
02:33:28 - 02:33:33
a garrulousness due to an inner pleasure in noise and confused emotions, for example,
02:33:33 - 02:33:35
in Carlyle.
02:33:35 - 02:33:37
98.
02:33:37 - 02:33:39
Tobre
02:33:39 - 02:33:44
In praise of Shakespeare, I could not say anything more beautiful in praise of Shakespeare
02:33:44 - 02:33:49
as a human being than this, he believed in Brutus and did not cast one speck of suspicion
02:33:49 - 02:33:51
upon this type of virtue.
02:33:51 - 02:33:57
It was to him that he devoted his best tragedy, it is still called by the wrong name, to him
02:33:57 - 02:34:04
and to the most awesome quintessence of a lofty morality, independence of the soul,
02:34:04 - 02:34:05
that is at stake here.
02:34:05 - 02:34:11
No sacrifice can be too great for that, one must be capable of sacrificing one's dearest
02:34:11 - 02:34:16
friend for it, even if he should also be the most glorious human being, an ornament
02:34:16 - 02:34:23
of the world, a genius without peer, if one loves freedom as the freedom of great souls,
02:34:23 - 02:34:25
and he threatens this kind of freedom.
02:34:25 - 02:34:28
That is what Shakespeare must have felt.
02:34:28 - 02:34:33
The height at which he places Caesar is the finest honor that he could bestow on Brutus,
02:34:33 - 02:34:38
that is how he raises beyond measure Brutus's inner problem as well as the spiritual strength
02:34:38 - 02:34:40
that was able to cut this knot.
02:34:40 - 02:34:45
Could it really have been political freedom that led this poet to sympathize with Brutus
02:34:45 - 02:34:49
and turned him into Brutus's accomplice, or was political freedom only a symbol for
02:34:49 - 02:34:51
something inexpressible?
02:34:51 - 02:34:56
Could it be that we confront some unknown dark event and adventure in the poet's own
02:34:56 - 02:35:00
soul of which he wants to speak only in signs?
02:35:00 - 02:35:04
What is all of Hamlet's melancholy compared to that of Brutus?
02:35:04 - 02:35:09
And perhaps Shakespeare knew both from first-hand experience, perhaps he too had his gloomy
02:35:09 - 02:35:12
hour and his evil angel, like Brutus.
02:35:12 - 02:35:17
But whatever similarities and secret relationships there may have been, before the whole figure
02:35:17 - 02:35:24
and virtue of Brutus, Shakespeare prostrated himself, feeling unworthy and remote.
02:35:24 - 02:35:28
His witness of this is written into the tragedy.
02:35:28 - 02:35:32
Twice he brings in a poet and twice he pours such an impatient and ultimate contempt over
02:35:32 - 02:35:36
him that it sounds like a cry, the cry of self-contempt.
02:35:37 - 02:35:44
Brutus, even Brutus, loses patience as the poet enters, conceited, pompous, obtrusive,
02:35:44 - 02:35:50
as poets often are, apparently overflowing with possibilities of greatness, including
02:35:50 - 02:35:55
moral greatness, although in the philosophy of his deeds and his life he rarely attains
02:35:55 - 02:35:57
even ordinary integrity.
02:35:57 - 02:36:00
I'll know his humor when he knows his time.
02:36:00 - 02:36:03
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
02:36:03 - 02:36:06
Companion, hence, shouts Brutus.
02:36:06 - 02:36:10
This should be translated back into the soul of the poet who wrote it.
02:36:10 - 02:36:13
99
02:36:13 - 02:36:16
Schopenhauer's Followers
02:36:16 - 02:36:20
What happens when barbarians come into contact with a higher culture?
02:36:20 - 02:36:25
The lower culture always accepts, first of all, the vices, weaknesses, and excesses,
02:36:25 - 02:36:31
and only then, on that basis, finds a certain attraction in the higher culture, and eventually,
02:36:31 - 02:36:36
by way of the vices and weaknesses that it has acquired, also accepts some of the overflow
02:36:36 - 02:36:42
of what really has value, that can also be observed nearby, without traveling to remote
02:36:42 - 02:36:44
barbarian tribes.
02:36:44 - 02:36:49
Of course, what we see near us is somewhat refined and spiritualized and not quite so
02:36:49 - 02:36:51
palpable.
02:36:51 - 02:36:55
What do Schopenhauer's German followers generally accept, first of all, from their
02:36:55 - 02:36:57
master?
02:36:57 - 02:37:02
In comparison with his superior culture, they must surely feel barbarous enough to be initially
02:37:02 - 02:37:05
fascinated and seduced by him like barbarians.
02:37:05 - 02:37:11
Is it his sense for hard facts, his goodwill for clarity and reason, which so often makes
02:37:11 - 02:37:16
him appear so English and un-German, or the strength of his intellectual conscience that
02:37:16 - 02:37:21
endured a lifelong contradiction between being and willing, and also compelled him to contradict
02:37:21 - 02:37:27
himself continually in his writings on almost every point, or his cleanliness in questions
02:37:27 - 02:37:29
about the church and the Christian God?
02:37:29 - 02:37:34
For here, his cleanliness was quite unprecedented among German philosophers, and he lived and
02:37:34 - 02:37:37
died as a Voltarian.
02:37:37 - 02:37:43
Or his immortal doctrines of the intellectuality of intuition, of the a priori nature of the
02:37:43 - 02:37:48
causal law, of the instrumental character of the intellect and the unfreedom of the
02:37:48 - 02:37:49
will?
02:37:49 - 02:37:52
No, none of this enchants his German followers.
02:37:52 - 02:37:55
They do not find it enchanting at all.
02:37:55 - 02:37:59
But Schopenhauer's mystical embarrassments and subterfuges in those places where the
02:37:59 - 02:38:05
factual thinker allowed himself to be seduced and corrupted by the vain urge to be the unriddler
02:38:05 - 02:38:12
of the world, the unprovable doctrine of the one will, all causes are merely occasional
02:38:12 - 02:38:17
causes of the appearance of the will at this time and at this place, and the will to life
02:38:17 - 02:38:24
is present whole and undivided in every being, including the least, as completely as in
02:38:24 - 02:38:30
all beings that ever have been, are, and shall be, if they were all taken together.
02:38:30 - 02:38:35
The denial of the individual, all lions are at bottom only one lion, the plurality of
02:38:35 - 02:38:41
individuals is mere appearance, even as development is mere appearance.
02:38:41 - 02:38:45
He calls Lamarck's idea an ingenious but absurd error.
02:38:45 - 02:38:51
His ecstatic reveries about genius, in aesthetic contemplation, the individual is no longer
02:38:51 - 02:38:57
an individual but the pure, willless, painless, timeless subject of knowledge.
02:38:57 - 02:39:02
As the subject is wholly absorbed in the object that it contemplates, it becomes this object
02:39:02 - 02:39:03
itself.
02:39:03 - 02:39:09
The nonsense about pity, about how it makes possible a breakthrough the principium individuationis
02:39:09 - 02:39:15
and how this is the source of all morality, also such claims as dying is really the purpose
02:39:15 - 02:39:21
of existence, and a priori, one cannot altogether deny the possibility that magical effects
02:39:21 - 02:39:24
might emanate from one who has died.
02:39:24 - 02:39:29
These and other such excesses and vices of the philosopher are always accepted first
02:39:29 - 02:39:34
of all and turned into articles of faith, for vices and excesses are always aped most
02:39:34 - 02:39:37
easily and require no long training.
02:39:37 - 02:39:43
But let us discuss the most famous living follower of Schopenhauer, Richard Wagner.
02:39:43 - 02:39:46
What happened to him has happened to many artists.
02:39:46 - 02:39:51
He misinterpreted the characters that he himself had created and misunderstood the philosophy
02:39:51 - 02:39:55
that was implicit in his most characteristic works of art.
02:39:55 - 02:40:01
Until the middle of his life, Richard Wagner allowed himself to be led astray by Hegel.
02:40:01 - 02:40:06
Later, the same thing happened to him a second time when he began to read Schopenhauer's
02:40:06 - 02:40:13
doctrine into his characters and to apply to himself such categories as will, genius,
02:40:13 - 02:40:14
and pity.
02:40:14 - 02:40:20
Nevertheless, it will remain true that nothing could be more contrary to the spirit of Schopenhauer
02:40:20 - 02:40:24
than what is distinctively Wagnerian in Wagner's heroes.
02:40:24 - 02:40:29
I mean the innocence of the utmost selfishness, the faith in great passion as the good in
02:40:29 - 02:40:30
itself.
02:40:30 - 02:40:37
In one word, what is Siegfried like in the countenance of his heroes?
02:40:37 - 02:40:42
All this smells more even of Spinoza than it does of me.
02:40:42 - 02:40:46
Schopenhauer himself might say, although Wagner would have good reasons to look for
02:40:46 - 02:40:51
some other philosopher rather than Schopenhauer, the spell that this thinker has cast over
02:40:51 - 02:40:58
him has blinded him not only to all other philosophies, but even to science itself.
02:40:58 - 02:41:02
More and more, his whole art wants to present itself as a companion piece and supplement
02:41:02 - 02:41:04
to Schopenhauer's philosophy.
02:41:04 - 02:41:09
And more and more explicitly, it renounces the loftier ambition of becoming a companion
02:41:09 - 02:41:12
piece and supplement to human knowledge and science.
02:41:12 - 02:41:17
Nor is it only the whole mysterious pomp of this philosophy which would also have attracted
02:41:17 - 02:41:22
a Cagliostro, but the gestures and passions of the philosophers have always been seductive
02:41:22 - 02:41:24
too.
02:41:24 - 02:41:28
Wagner is Schopenhauerian, for example, in his exasperation over the corruption of the
02:41:28 - 02:41:30
German language.
02:41:30 - 02:41:34
And if one should applaud his imitation at this point, it should not be overlooked that
02:41:34 - 02:41:39
Wagner's own style suffers rather heavily from all the ulcers and swellings whose sight
02:41:39 - 02:41:41
enraged Schopenhauer.
02:41:41 - 02:41:46
And as for the Wagnerians who write German, Wagnerism is beginning to prove as dangerous
02:41:46 - 02:41:49
as any Hegelisms ever did.
02:41:49 - 02:41:54
Wagner is Schopenhauerian in his hatred of the Jews, to whom he is not able to do justice
02:41:54 - 02:41:57
even when it comes to their greatest deed.
02:41:57 - 02:42:01
After all, the Jews are the inventors of Christianity.
02:42:01 - 02:42:06
Wagner is Schopenhauerian in his attempts to understand Christianity as a seed of Buddhism
02:42:06 - 02:42:11
that has been carried far away by the wind, and to prepare a Buddhistic epoch in Europe,
02:42:11 - 02:42:16
with an occasional rapprochement with Catholic-Christian formulas and sentiments.
02:42:16 - 02:42:21
Wagner is Schopenhauerian when he preaches mercy in our relations with animals.
02:42:21 - 02:42:25
As we know, Schopenhauer's predecessor at this point was Voltaire, who may already have
02:42:25 - 02:42:31
mastered the art that we encounter among his successors, to dress up his hatred against
02:42:31 - 02:42:35
certain things and people as mercy for animals.
02:42:35 - 02:42:40
At least Wagner's hatred of science, which finds expression in his preachment, is certainly
02:42:40 - 02:42:46
not inspired by any spirit of kind-heartedness and benignity, nor indeed, as is obvious,
02:42:46 - 02:42:50
by anything meriting the name of spirit.
02:42:50 - 02:42:54
Of course, the philosophy of an artist does not matter much if it is merely an afterthought
02:42:54 - 02:42:56
and does not harm his art.
02:42:56 - 02:43:02
One cannot be too careful to avoid bearing any artist a grudge for an occasional, perhaps
02:43:02 - 02:43:06
very unfortunate and presumptuous masquerade.
02:43:06 - 02:43:10
We should not forget that without exception, our dear artists are, and have to be to some
02:43:10 - 02:43:16
extent, actors, and without play-acting, they would scarcely endure life for any length
02:43:16 - 02:43:17
of time.
02:43:17 - 02:43:22
Let us remain faithful to Wagner in what is true and authentic in him, and especially
02:43:22 - 02:43:27
in this, that we, as his disciples, remain faithful to ourselves in what is true and
02:43:27 - 02:43:29
authentic in us.
02:43:29 - 02:43:33
Let him have his intellectual tempers and cramps.
02:43:33 - 02:43:37
Let us, in all fairness, ask what strange nourishments and needs an art like this may
02:43:37 - 02:43:41
require to be able to live and grow.
02:43:41 - 02:43:46
It does not matter that as a thinker he is so often in the wrong, justice and patience
02:43:46 - 02:43:52
are not for him, enough that his life is justified before itself, and remains justified,
02:43:52 - 02:43:58
this life which shouts at every one of us, Be a man and do not follow me, but yourself,
02:43:58 - 02:44:00
but yourself.
02:44:00 - 02:44:05
Our life, too, shall remain justified in our own eyes, we, too, shall grow and blossom
02:44:05 - 02:44:10
out of ourselves, free and fearless, in innocent selfishness.
02:44:10 - 02:44:16
And as I contemplate such a human being, these sentences still come to my mind today as formerly
02:44:17 - 02:44:22
That passion is better than stoicism and hypocrisy, that being honest in evil is still better
02:44:22 - 02:44:27
than losing oneself to the morality of tradition, that a free human being can be good as well
02:44:27 - 02:44:34
as evil, but that the unfree human being is a blemish upon nature, and has no share in
02:44:34 - 02:44:36
any heavenly or earthly comfort.
02:44:36 - 02:44:42
Finally, that everyone who wishes to become free must become free through his own endeavor,
02:44:42 - 02:44:47
and that freedom does not fall into any man's lap as a miraculous gift.

100.
02:44:54 - 02:44:56
Learning to pay homage.
02:44:56 - 02:45:00
Men have to learn to pay homage no less than to feel contempt.
02:45:00 - 02:45:04
Anyone who breaks new paths, and who has led many others on to new paths, discovers with
02:45:04 - 02:45:10
some amazement how clumsy and poor these people are in their capacity for expressing gratitude,
02:45:10 - 02:45:14
and how rarely gratitude achieves expression at all.
02:45:14 - 02:45:20
It almost seems that whenever gratitude wants to speak, she begins to gag, clears her throat,
02:45:20 - 02:45:24
and falls silent before she has got out a word.
02:45:24 - 02:45:28
The way in which a thinker gets some notion of the effects of his ideas and of their transforming
02:45:28 - 02:45:32
revolutionary power is almost a comedy.
02:45:32 - 02:45:37
At times it seems as if those who have felt this effect actually feel insulted, and as
02:45:37 - 02:45:42
if they could express what they consider their threatened self-reliance only by bad
02:45:42 - 02:45:43
manners.
02:45:43 - 02:45:49
Whole generations are required merely to invent a polite convention for thanks, and it is
02:45:49 - 02:45:55
only very late that we reach the moment when gratitude acquires a kind of spirit and genius.
02:45:55 - 02:46:01
By then, there is usually also someone who becomes the recipient of great gratitude,
02:46:01 - 02:46:06
not only for the good he himself has done, but above all, for the treasure of what is
02:46:06 - 02:46:13
best and highest that has gradually been accumulated by his predecessors.
02:46:13 - 02:46:17
101 Voltaire
02:46:17 - 02:46:21
Wherever there was a court, there were laws governing good speech, and thus also laws
02:46:21 - 02:46:24
about style for all who wrote.
02:46:24 - 02:46:28
But the language of the court is the courtier's language, and since he has no professional
02:46:28 - 02:46:33
specialty he does not permit himself, even in conversation about scientific matters,
02:46:33 - 02:46:38
convenient technical expressions, for they smack of professional specialties.
02:46:38 - 02:46:44
In countries with a courtly culture, technical expressions and anything that betrays a specialist
02:46:44 - 02:46:48
are therefore considered stylistic blemishes.
02:46:48 - 02:46:52
Now that every court has become a caricature of the past and present, one is amazed to
02:46:52 - 02:46:57
find even Voltaire incredibly prim and fastidious at this point.
02:46:57 - 02:47:02
For example, in his judgments about such stylists as Fontenelle and Montesquieu.
02:47:02 - 02:47:09
For all of us are now emancipated from courtly taste, while Voltaire perfected it.
02:47:09 - 02:47:11
102
02:47:11 - 02:47:17
A Remark for Philologists
02:47:17 - 02:47:21
That some books are so valuable and so royal that whole generations of scholars are well
02:47:21 - 02:47:27
employed if their labor is to preserve these books in a state that is pure and intelligible,
02:47:27 - 02:47:31
philology exists in order to fortify this faith again and again.
02:47:31 - 02:47:37
It presupposes that there is no lack of those rare human beings, even if one does not see
02:47:37 - 02:47:43
them, who really know how to use such valuable books, presumably those who write, or could
02:47:43 - 02:47:45
write, books of the same type.
02:47:45 - 02:47:50
I mean that philology presupposes a noble faith that for the sake of a very few human
02:47:50 - 02:47:57
beings who always will come but are never there, a very large amount of fastidious and
02:47:57 - 02:48:00
even dirty work needs to be done first.
02:48:00 - 02:48:04
All of it is work in usum Delphinorum.
02:48:04 - 02:48:09
103
02:48:09 - 02:48:10
Of German Music
02:48:10 - 02:48:15
Today, German music is, more than any other, the music of Europe, if only because it alone
02:48:15 - 02:48:19
has given expression to the transformation of Europe through the Revolution.
02:48:19 - 02:48:24
Only German composers know how to lend expression to an excited mass of people, creating an
02:48:24 - 02:48:30
immense artificial noise that does not even need to be very loud, while Italian opera,
02:48:30 - 02:48:35
for example, features only choruses of servants or soldiers but no people.
02:48:35 - 02:48:42
Moreover, in all German music we hear a profound bourgeois envy of nobility, especially of
02:48:42 - 02:48:49
esprit and elegance as expressions of a courtly, knightly, old, self-assured society.
02:48:49 - 02:48:54
This music is not like that of Goethe's Singer Outside the Gate, which is also appreciated
02:48:54 - 02:48:57
in the great hall of the castle, by the king.
02:48:57 - 02:48:59
The idea is not.
02:48:59 - 02:49:04
The knights had a courageous look, the fair looked at their laps.
02:49:04 - 02:49:09
Even the graces do not appear in German music without being accompanied by a bad conscience.
02:49:09 - 02:49:15
Only with charm, the rural sister of the graces, can the Germans begin to feel wholly moral
02:49:15 - 02:49:21
and from that point on, more and more so, all the way up to their rapturous, scholarly
02:49:21 - 02:49:26
and often saturnine, sublimity, à la Beethoven.
02:49:26 - 02:49:30
If you want to imagine the human being that goes with this music, merely imagine Beethoven
02:49:30 - 02:49:37
as he appears beside Goethe, say at their encounter in Teplitz, as semi-barbarism beside
02:49:37 - 02:49:43
culture, as the people beside nobility, as the good-natured human being next to the good,
02:49:43 - 02:49:48
who is more than merely a good human being, as the visionary beside the artist, as the
02:49:48 - 02:49:53
man in need of comfort next to the man who is comforted, as the man of exaggeration and
02:49:53 - 02:49:59
suspicion next to one who is fair-minded, as the mope and self-tormentor, who is foolishly
02:49:59 - 02:50:06
ecstatic, blissfully unhappy, guilelessly extravagant, presumptuous and crude, and in
02:50:06 - 02:50:10
sum, as the untamed human being.
02:50:10 - 02:50:16
That is what Goethe felt about him and called him, Goethe, the exception among Germans.
02:50:16 - 02:50:19
No music of his rank has yet been found.
02:50:19 - 02:50:23
Finally, we might ask whether the contempt for melody that is now spreading more and
02:50:23 - 02:50:28
more and the atrophy of the melodic sense in Germany should be understood as democratic
02:50:28 - 02:50:32
bad manners and an after-effect of the revolution.
02:50:32 - 02:50:38
For melody delights so openly in lawfulness and has such an antipathy for everything that
02:50:38 - 02:50:44
is still becoming, still unformed and arbitrary, that it sounds like an echo of the old order
02:50:44 - 02:50:49
in Europe and like a seduction to go back to that.
02:50:49 - 02:50:52
104
02:50:52 - 02:50:55
Of the Sound of the German Language
02:50:55 - 02:50:59
We now know where the language comes from that for a few centuries has been accepted
02:50:59 - 02:51:01
as literary German.
02:51:01 - 02:51:06
The Germans, with their reverence for everything that came from the court, have studiously
02:51:06 - 02:51:11
modeled their style on officialdom whenever they had to write anything, such as letters,
02:51:11 - 02:51:15
documents, wills, and so forth.
02:51:15 - 02:51:21
To write Chancery German meant writing like the court and government and was elegant compared
02:51:21 - 02:51:24
to the German of the city in which one happened to live.
02:51:24 - 02:51:28
Eventually one drew the consequence of also speaking as one wrote.
02:51:28 - 02:51:32
That way one became still more elegant in the forms of the words used, in the choice
02:51:32 - 02:51:37
of words and phrases, and ultimately also in sound.
02:51:37 - 02:51:41
One affected the tone of the court when one spoke, and in the end this affectation became
02:51:41 - 02:51:43
second nature.
02:51:43 - 02:51:47
Perhaps nothing quite like this has happened anywhere else, the triumph of the written
02:51:47 - 02:51:53
style over speech and the affectation and snobbery of a whole people as the basis for
02:51:53 - 02:51:56
a common language that transcended dialects.
02:51:56 - 02:52:01
I believe that the sound of the German language during the Middle Ages and especially after
02:52:01 - 02:52:05
that was profoundly rustic and vulgar.
02:52:05 - 02:52:08
During the last few centuries it has become a little more elegant primarily because one
02:52:08 - 02:52:14
was compelled to imitate so many French, Italian, and Spanish sounds, which was especially true
02:52:14 - 02:52:20
of the German and Austrian nobility, who simply could not manage with their mother tongue.
02:52:20 - 02:52:25
But in spite of this practice, German must have sounded intolerably vulgar to Montaigne
02:52:25 - 02:52:32
or even more so Racine, and to this day German travelers in the midst of an Italian mob still
02:52:32 - 02:52:39
sound very rude, woodsy, and hoarse, as if they came from smoky rooms and impolite regions.
02:52:39 - 02:52:45
Now I note that once again the former admirers of officialdom are succumbing rapidly to a
02:52:45 - 02:52:50
similar craving for an elegant tone, and the Germans are submitting to a most peculiar
02:52:50 - 02:52:55
acoustic spell that in the long run could become a real danger to the German language,
02:52:55 - 02:53:00
for one would seek in vain all over Europe to find more abhorrent sounds.
02:53:00 - 02:53:07
Something scornful, cold, indifferent, and careless in one's voice.
02:53:07 - 02:53:10
That is what the Germans now consider elegant.
02:53:10 - 02:53:15
I hear the goodwill to achieve such elegance in the voices of young officials, teachers,
02:53:15 - 02:53:17
women, merchants.
02:53:17 - 02:53:22
Even little girls are beginning to imitate this officer's German, for it is the officers,
02:53:22 - 02:53:28
specifically Prussian officers, who have set this tone, although as military men and specialists
02:53:28 - 02:53:33
these same officers possess an admirably tactful modesty from which all Germans could
02:53:33 - 02:53:38
learn something, including German professors and composers.
02:53:38 - 02:53:43
But as soon as he speaks and moves, the German officer is the most immodest and distasteful
02:53:43 - 02:53:48
figure in old Europe, quite unselfconsciously, no doubt.
02:53:48 - 02:53:52
Nor are our dear Germans aware of this when they admire him as the paragon of the highest
02:53:52 - 02:53:57
and most elegant society, and gladly let him set the tone.
02:53:57 - 02:54:00
And that is precisely what he does.
02:54:00 - 02:54:06
First of all, the sergeants and non-commissioned officers imitate and coarsen his tone.
02:54:06 - 02:54:10
Just listen to the sound of the commands, whose roar surrounds the German cities now
02:54:10 - 02:54:13
that they drill outside all gates.
02:54:13 - 02:54:20
What arrogance, what raging sense of authority, what scornful coldness speak out of this roaring.
02:54:20 - 02:54:23
Could the Germans really be a musical people?
02:54:23 - 02:54:28
Unquestionably, the Germans are becoming militarized in the sound of their language.
02:54:28 - 02:54:32
Probably once they are accustomed to speaking in a military tone, they will eventually also
02:54:32 - 02:54:34
write that way.
02:54:34 - 02:54:39
Becoming accustomed to certain sounds has a profound effect on character.
02:54:39 - 02:54:39
Soon one acquires the
02:54:39 - 02:54:45
words and phrases, and eventually also the ideas that go with these sounds.
02:54:45 - 02:54:49
Perhaps the Germans have already begun to write like officers.
02:54:49 - 02:54:52
Perhaps I merely read too little of what is now written in Germany.
02:54:52 - 02:54:55
But there is one thing I know much more certainly.
02:54:55 - 02:55:00
The public German proclamations that are heard in other countries, too, are not inspired
02:55:00 - 02:55:05
by German music, but by this new sound of distasteful arrogance.
02:55:05 - 02:55:10
In almost every speech of the foremost German statesman, even when he is heard only through
02:55:10 - 02:55:16
his imperial mouthpiece, we hear an accent that repels and disgusts the ears of foreigners.
02:55:16 - 02:55:18
But the Germans tolerate it.
02:55:18 - 02:55:21
They tolerate themselves.
02:55:21 - 02:55:27
105 The Germans as Artists
02:55:27 - 02:55:32
When the Germans really work up a passion, and not merely the goodwill to feel a passion,
02:55:32 - 02:55:37
as they usually do, they behave as they cannot help but behave and do not give any thought
02:55:37 - 02:55:40
to their conduct.
02:55:40 - 02:55:45
Actually their behavior at such times is very clumsy and ugly, as if it were totally lacking
02:55:45 - 02:55:51
in tact and melody, and the spectators merely feel pained or touched, unless the Germans
02:55:51 - 02:55:56
rise into the sphere of rapture and sublimity of which some passions are capable.
02:55:56 - 02:56:00
When that happens, even Germans become beautiful.
02:56:00 - 02:56:06
A vague sense of the heights that are required before beauty pours her magic, even upon Germans'
02:56:06 - 02:56:12
drives, German artists into heights and super-heights and into excesses of passion, in other words,
02:56:12 - 02:56:19
a really deep craving to rise beyond, or at least look beyond, ugliness and clumsiness
02:56:19 - 02:56:23
toward a better, lighter, more southern, sunnier world.
02:56:23 - 02:56:28
Thus their cramps are often no more than signs that they would like to dance, these poor
02:56:28 - 02:56:33
bears in whom hidden nymphs and sylvan gods are carrying on, and at times even higher
02:56:33 - 02:56:35
deities.
02:56:35 - 02:56:39
106 MUSIC AS AN ADVOCATE
02:56:39 - 02:56:46
I am thirsting for a composer, said an innovator to his disciple, who would learn my ideas
02:56:46 - 02:56:48
from me and transpose them into his language.
02:56:48 - 02:56:52
That way I should reach men's ears and hearts far better.
02:56:52 - 02:56:56
With music one can seduce men to every error and every truth.
02:56:56 - 02:56:58
Who could refute a tone?
02:56:58 - 02:57:02
Then you would like to be considered irrefutable, said his disciple.
02:57:02 - 02:57:06
The innovator replied, I wish for the seedling to become a tree.
02:57:06 - 02:57:11
For a doctrine to become a tree, it has to be believed for a good while.
02:57:11 - 02:57:14
For it to be believed, it has to be considered irrefutable.
02:57:14 - 02:57:20
The tree needs storms, doubts, worms, and nastiness to reveal the nature and the strength
02:57:20 - 02:57:22
of the seedling.
02:57:22 - 02:57:25
Let it break, if it is not strong enough.
02:57:25 - 02:57:30
But a seedling can only be destroyed, not refuted.
02:57:30 - 02:57:36
When he had said that, his disciple cried impetuously, but I believe in your cause and
02:57:36 - 02:57:41
consider it so strong that I shall say everything, everything that I still have in my mind against
02:57:41 - 02:57:43
it.
02:57:43 - 02:57:47
The innovator laughed in his heart and wagged a finger at him.
02:57:47 - 02:57:53
This kind of discipleship, he said then, is the best, but it is also the most dangerous
02:57:53 - 02:57:57
and not every kind of doctrine can endure it.
02:57:57 - 02:58:02
107
02:58:02 - 02:58:05
Our Ultimate Gratitude to Art
02:58:05 - 02:58:09
If we had not welcomed the arts and invented this kind of cult of the untrue, then the
02:58:09 - 02:58:15
realization of general untruth and mendaciousness that now comes to us through science, the
02:58:15 - 02:58:20
realization that delusion and error are conditions of human knowledge and sensation, would be
02:58:20 - 02:58:22
utterly unbearable.
02:58:22 - 02:58:28
Honesty would lead to nausea and suicide, but now there is a counterforce against our
02:58:28 - 02:58:35
honesty that helps us to avoid such consequences, art as the goodwill to appearance.
02:58:35 - 02:58:40
We do not always keep our eyes from rounding off something and, as it were, finishing the
02:58:40 - 02:58:47
poem, and then it is no longer eternal imperfection that we carry across the river of becoming,
02:58:47 - 02:58:52
then we have the sense of carrying a goddess and feel proud and childlike as we perform
02:58:52 - 02:58:54
this service.
02:58:54 - 02:58:59
As an aesthetic phenomenon, existence is still bearable for us, and art furnishes us with
02:58:59 - 02:59:05
eyes and hands, and above all the good conscience to be able to turn ourselves into such a phenomenon.
02:59:05 - 02:59:11
At times we need a rest from ourselves by looking upon, by looking down upon, ourselves
02:59:11 - 02:59:17
and from an artistic distance, laughing over ourselves or weeping over ourselves.
02:59:17 - 02:59:21
We must discover the hero no less than the fool in our passion for knowledge, we must
02:59:21 - 02:59:26
occasionally find pleasure in our folly, or we cannot continue to find pleasure in
02:59:26 - 02:59:32
our wisdom, precisely because we are at bottom grave and serious human beings, really, more
02:59:32 - 02:59:35
weights than human beings.
02:59:35 - 02:59:40
Nothing does us as much good as a fool's cap, we need it in relation to ourselves,
02:59:40 - 02:59:45
we need all exuberant, floating, dancing, mocking, childish, and blissful art, lest
02:59:45 - 02:59:49
we lose the freedom above things that our ideal demands of us.
02:59:49 - 02:59:55
It would mean a relapse for us with our irritable honesty, to get involved entirely in morality
02:59:55 - 03:00:01
and, for the sake of the over-severe demands that we make on ourselves in these matters,
03:00:01 - 03:00:04
to become virtuous monsters and scarecrows.
03:00:04 - 03:00:10
We should be able also to stand above morality, and not only to stand with the anxious stiffness
03:00:10 - 03:00:15
of a man who is afraid of slipping and falling any moment, but also to float above it and
03:00:15 - 03:00:17
play.
03:00:17 - 03:00:22
How then could we possibly dispense with art, and with the fool?
03:00:22 - 03:00:29
And as long as you are in any way ashavied before yourselves, you do not yet belong with us.
03:00:29 - 03:00:32
Book Three
03:00:32 - 03:00:35
One Hundred Eight
03:00:35 - 03:00:36
New Struggles
03:00:36 - 03:00:42
After Buddha was dead, his shadow was still shown for centuries in a cave, a tremendous,
03:00:42 - 03:00:44
gruesome shadow.
03:00:44 - 03:00:49
God is dead, but given the way of men, there may still be caves for thousands of years
03:00:49 - 03:00:51
in which his shadow will be shown.
03:00:51 - 03:00:56
And we, we still have to vanquish his shadow too.
03:00:56 - 03:01:00
One Hundred Nine
03:01:00 - 03:01:02
Let us beware.
03:01:02 - 03:01:05
Let us beware of thinking that the world is a living being.
03:01:05 - 03:01:07
Where should it expand?
03:01:07 - 03:01:09
On what should it feed?
03:01:09 - 03:01:11
How could it grow and multiply?
03:01:11 - 03:01:16
We have some notion of the nature of the organic, and we should not reinterpret the exceedingly
03:01:16 - 03:01:23
derivative, late, rare, accidental, that we perceive only on the crust of the earth and
03:01:23 - 03:01:28
make of it something essential, universal, and eternal, which is what those people do
03:01:28 - 03:01:31
who call the universe an organism.
03:01:31 - 03:01:33
This nauseates me.
03:01:33 - 03:01:37
Let us even beware of believing that the universe is a machine.
03:01:37 - 03:01:43
It is certainly not constructed for one purpose, and calling it a machine does it far too much
03:01:43 - 03:01:44
honor.
03:01:44 - 03:01:49
Let us beware of positing generally and everywhere anything as elegant as the cyclical movements
03:01:49 - 03:01:51
of our neighboring stars.
03:01:51 - 03:01:57
Even a glance into the Milky Way raises doubts whether there are not far coarser and more
03:01:57 - 03:02:03
contradictory movements there, as well as stars with eternally linear paths, etc.
03:02:03 - 03:02:06
The astral order in which we live is an exception.
03:02:06 - 03:02:11
This order, and the relative duration that depends on it, have again made possible an
03:02:11 - 03:02:17
exception of exceptions, the formation of the organic.
03:02:17 - 03:02:22
The total character of the world, however, is in all eternity chaos, in the sense not
03:02:22 - 03:02:29
of a lack of necessity but of a lack of order, arrangement, form, beauty, wisdom, and whatever
03:02:29 - 03:02:33
other names there are for our aesthetic anthropomorphisms.
03:02:33 - 03:02:37
Judged from the point of view of our reason, unsuccessful attempts are by all odds the
03:02:37 - 03:02:43
rule, the exceptions are not the secret aim, and the whole musical box repeats eternally
03:02:43 - 03:02:47
its tune, which may never be called a melody.
03:02:47 - 03:02:54
And ultimately even the phrase unsuccessful attempt is too anthropomorphic and reproachful.
03:02:54 - 03:02:57
But how could we reproach or praise the universe?
03:02:57 - 03:03:03
Let us beware of attributing to it heartlessness and unreason, or their opposites.
03:03:03 - 03:03:09
It is neither perfect nor beautiful nor noble, nor does it wish to become any of these things.
03:03:09 - 03:03:13
It does not by any means strive to imitate man.
03:03:13 - 03:03:17
None of our aesthetic and moral judgments apply to it, nor does it have any instinct
03:03:17 - 03:03:24
for self-preservation or any other instinct, and it does not observe any laws either.
03:03:24 - 03:03:27
Let us beware of saying that there are laws in nature.
03:03:27 - 03:03:29
There are only necessities.
03:03:29 - 03:03:35
There is nobody who commands, nobody who obeys, nobody who trespasses.
03:03:35 - 03:03:39
Once you know that there are no purposes, you also know that there is no accident, for
03:03:39 - 03:03:46
it is only beside a world of purposes that the word accident has meaning.
03:03:46 - 03:03:49
Let us beware of saying that death is opposed to life.
03:03:49 - 03:03:54
The living is merely a type of what is dead, and a very rare type.
03:03:54 - 03:03:58
Let us beware of thinking that the world eternally creates new things.
03:03:58 - 03:04:01
There are no eternally enduring substances.
03:04:01 - 03:04:05
Matter is as much of an error as the God of the Iliadics.
03:04:05 - 03:04:09
But when shall we ever be done with our caution and care?
03:04:09 - 03:04:14
When will all these shadows of God cease to darken our minds?
03:04:14 - 03:04:17
When will we complete our de-deification of nature?
03:04:17 - 03:04:23
When may we begin to naturalize humanity in terms of a pure, newly discovered, newly redeemed
03:04:23 - 03:04:25
nature?
03:04:25 - 03:04:31
110 Origin of Knowledge
03:04:31 - 03:04:36
Over immense periods of time, the intellect produced nothing but errors.
03:04:36 - 03:04:40
A few of these proved to be useful and helped to preserve the species.
03:04:40 - 03:04:44
Those who hit upon or inherited these had better luck in their struggle for themselves
03:04:44 - 03:04:46
and their progeny.
03:04:46 - 03:04:51
Such erroneous articles of faith, which were continually inherited until they became almost
03:04:51 - 03:04:56
part of the basic endowment of the species, include the following.
03:04:56 - 03:04:58
That there are enduring things.
03:04:58 - 03:05:00
That there are equal things.
03:05:00 - 03:05:03
That there are things, substances, bodies.
03:05:03 - 03:05:05
That a thing is what it appears to be.
03:05:05 - 03:05:07
That our will is free.
03:05:07 - 03:05:10
That what is good for me is also good in itself.
03:05:10 - 03:05:14
It was only very late that such propositions were denied and doubted.
03:05:14 - 03:05:19
It was only very late that truth emerged as the weakest form of knowledge.
03:05:19 - 03:05:22
It seemed that one was unable to live with it.
03:05:22 - 03:05:24
Our organism was prepared for the opposite.
03:05:24 - 03:05:29
All its higher functions, sense perception, and every kind of sensation worked with those
03:05:29 - 03:05:34
basic errors, which had been incorporated since time immemorial.
03:05:34 - 03:05:39
Indeed, even in the realm of knowledge, these propositions became the norms according to
03:05:39 - 03:05:45
which true and untrue were determined, down to the most remote regions of logic.
03:05:45 - 03:05:51
Thus the strength of knowledge does not depend on its degree of truth, but on its age, on
03:05:51 - 03:05:56
the degree to which it has been incorporated, on its character as a condition of life.
03:05:56 - 03:06:01
Where life and knowledge seemed to be at odds, there was never any real fight, but denial
03:06:01 - 03:06:05
and doubt were simply considered madness.
03:06:05 - 03:06:10
Those exceptional thinkers like the Eliatics, who nevertheless posited and clung to the
03:06:10 - 03:06:14
opposites of the natural errors, believed that it was possible to live in accordance
03:06:14 - 03:06:16
with these opposites.
03:06:16 - 03:06:20
They invented the sage as the man who was unchangeable and impersonal, the man of the
03:06:20 - 03:06:26
universality of intuition, who was one and all at the same time, with a special capacity
03:06:26 - 03:06:28
for his inverted knowledge.
03:06:28 - 03:06:33
They had the faith that their knowledge was also the principle of life.
03:06:33 - 03:06:38
But in order to claim all of this, they had to deceive themselves about their own state.
03:06:38 - 03:06:45
They had to attribute to themselves, fictitiously, impersonality and changeless duration.
03:06:45 - 03:06:48
They had to misapprehend the nature of the knower.
03:06:48 - 03:06:51
They had to deny the role of the impulses in knowledge.
03:06:51 - 03:06:57
And quite generally, they had to conceive of reason as a completely free and spontaneous
03:06:57 - 03:06:58
activity.
03:06:58 - 03:07:03
They shut their eyes to the fact that they, too, had arrived at their propositions through
03:07:03 - 03:07:09
opposition to common sense, or owing to a desire for tranquility, for soul possession,
03:07:09 - 03:07:11
or for dominion.
03:07:11 - 03:07:17
The subtler development of honesty and skepticism eventually made these people, too, impossible.
03:07:17 - 03:07:22
Their ways of living and judging were seen to be also dependent upon the primeval impulses
03:07:22 - 03:07:25
and basic errors of all sentient existence.
03:07:25 - 03:07:30
This subtler honesty and skepticism came into being wherever two contradictory sentences
03:07:30 - 03:07:36
appeared to be applicable to life, because both were compatible with the basic errors,
03:07:36 - 03:07:40
and it was therefore possible to argue about the higher or lower degree of utility for
03:07:40 - 03:07:41
life.
03:07:41 - 03:07:48
Also, wherever new propositions, though not useful for life, were also evidently not harmful
03:07:48 - 03:07:49
to life.
03:07:49 - 03:07:54
In such cases, there was room for the expression of an intellectual play impulse, and honesty
03:07:54 - 03:07:59
and skepticism were innocent and happy, like all play.
03:07:59 - 03:08:05
Gradually, the human brain became full of such judgments and convictions, and a ferment,
03:08:05 - 03:08:09
struggle, and lust for power developed in this tangle.
03:08:09 - 03:08:14
Not only utility and delight, but every kind of impulse took sides in this fight about
03:08:14 - 03:08:15
truths.
03:08:15 - 03:08:21
The intellectual fight became an occupation, an attraction, a profession, a duty, something
03:08:21 - 03:08:26
signified, and eventually knowledge and the striving for the true found their place as
03:08:26 - 03:08:30
a need, among other needs.
03:08:30 - 03:08:38
Henceforth not only faith and conviction, but also scrutiny, denial, mistrust, and contradiction
03:08:38 - 03:08:40
became a power.
03:08:40 - 03:08:46
All evil instincts were subordinated to knowledge, employed in her service, and acquired the splendor
03:08:46 - 03:08:52
of what is permitted, honored and useful, and eventually even the eye and innocence
03:08:52 - 03:08:54
of the good.
03:08:54 - 03:08:59
Thus knowledge became a piece of life itself, and hence a continually growing power, until
03:08:59 - 03:09:04
eventually knowledge collided with those primeval basic errors.
03:09:04 - 03:09:09
Two lives, two powers, both in the same human being.
03:09:09 - 03:09:14
A thinker is now that being in whom the impulse for truth and those life-preserving errors
03:09:14 - 03:09:20
clash for their first fight, after the impulse for truth has proved to be also a life-preserving
03:09:20 - 03:09:21
power.
03:09:21 - 03:09:26
Compared to the significance of this fight, everything else is a matter of indifference.
03:09:26 - 03:09:31
The ultimate question about the conditions of life has been posed here, and we confront
03:09:31 - 03:09:35
the first attempt to answer this question by experiment.
03:09:35 - 03:09:38
To what extent can truth endure incorporation?
03:09:38 - 03:09:40
That is the question.
03:09:40 - 03:09:42
That is the experiment.
03:09:42 - 03:09:46
111.
03:09:46 - 03:09:49
Origin of the Logical
03:09:49 - 03:09:54
How did logic come into existence in man's head, certainly out of illogic, whose realm
03:09:54 - 03:09:57
originally must have been immense?
03:09:57 - 03:10:01
Innumerable beings who made inferences in a way different from ours perished.
03:10:01 - 03:10:04
For all that, their ways might have been truer.
03:10:04 - 03:10:10
Those, for example, who did not know how to find often enough what is equal, as regards
03:10:10 - 03:10:15
both nourishment and hostile animals, those, in other words, who subsumed things too slowly
03:10:15 - 03:10:20
and cautiously, were favored with a lesser probability of survival than those who guessed
03:10:20 - 03:10:25
immediately upon encountering similar instances that they must be equal.
03:10:25 - 03:10:31
The dominant tendency, however, to treat as equal what is merrily similar, an illogical
03:10:31 - 03:10:38
tendency for nothing is really equal, is what first created any basis for logic.
03:10:38 - 03:10:43
In order that the concept of substance could originate, which is indispensable for logic
03:10:43 - 03:10:48
although in the strictest sense nothing real corresponds to it, it was likewise necessary
03:10:48 - 03:10:54
that for a long time one did not see nor perceive the changes in things.
03:10:54 - 03:10:59
The beings that did not see so precisely had an advantage over those that saw everything
03:10:59 - 03:11:01
in flux.
03:11:01 - 03:11:06
At bottom, every high degree of caution in making inferences and every skeptical tendency
03:11:06 - 03:11:09
constitute a great danger for life.
03:11:09 - 03:11:15
No living beings would have survived if the opposite tendency, to affirm rather than suspend
03:11:15 - 03:11:21
judgment, to err and make up things rather than wait, to assent rather than negate, to
03:11:21 - 03:11:27
pass judgment rather than be just, had not been bred to the point where it became extraordinarily
03:11:27 - 03:11:28
strong.
03:11:28 - 03:11:33
The course of logical ideas and inferences in our brain today corresponds to a process
03:11:33 - 03:11:39
and a struggle among impulses that are, taken singly, very illogical and unjust.
03:11:39 - 03:11:43
We generally experience only the result of this struggle because this primeval mechanism
03:11:43 - 03:11:49
now runs its course so quickly and is so well concealed.
03:11:49 - 03:11:55
1.12 Cause and Effect
03:11:55 - 03:11:59
Explanation is what we call it, but it is description that distinguishes us from older
03:11:59 - 03:12:02
stages of knowledge and science.
03:12:02 - 03:12:04
Our descriptions are better.
03:12:04 - 03:12:07
We do not explain any more than our predecessors.
03:12:07 - 03:12:12
We have uncovered a manifold one after another where the naive man and inquirer of older
03:12:12 - 03:12:20
cultures saw only two separate things, cause and effect, is what one says, but we have
03:12:20 - 03:12:26
merely perfected the image of becoming without reaching beyond the image or behind it.
03:12:26 - 03:12:32
In every case, the series of causes confronts us much more completely, and we infer first
03:12:32 - 03:12:39
this and that has to proceed in order that this or that may then follow.
03:12:39 - 03:12:41
But this does not involve any comprehension.
03:12:41 - 03:12:47
In every chemical process, for example, quality appears as a miracle, as ever.
03:12:47 - 03:12:50
Also, every locomotion.
03:12:50 - 03:12:53
Nobody has explained a push.
03:12:53 - 03:12:55
But how could we possibly explain anything?
03:12:55 - 03:12:59
We operate only with things that do not exist.
03:12:59 - 03:13:07
Lines, planes, bodies, atoms, divisible time spans, divisible spaces.
03:13:07 - 03:13:12
How should explanations be at all possible when we first turn everything into an image,
03:13:12 - 03:13:14
our image?
03:13:14 - 03:13:19
It will do to consider science as an attempt to humanize things as faithfully as possible.
03:13:19 - 03:13:24
As we describe things, and they are one after another, we learn how to describe ourselves
03:13:24 - 03:13:28
more and more precisely.
03:13:28 - 03:13:30
Cause and effect.
03:13:30 - 03:13:33
Such a duality probably never exists.
03:13:33 - 03:13:38
In truth, we are confronted by a continuum out of which we isolate a couple of pieces,
03:13:38 - 03:13:43
just as we perceive motion only as isolated points, and then infer it without ever actually
03:13:43 - 03:13:45
seeing it.
03:13:45 - 03:13:49
The suddenness with which many effects stand out misleads us.
03:13:49 - 03:13:52
Actually, it is sudden only for us.
03:13:52 - 03:13:57
In this moment of suddenness, there is an infinite number of processes that elude us.
03:13:57 - 03:14:02
An intellect that could see cause and effect as a continuum and a flux, and not, as we
03:14:02 - 03:14:07
do, in terms of an arbitrary division and dismemberment, would repudiate the concept
03:14:07 - 03:14:12
of cause and effect and deny all conditionality.
03:14:12 - 03:14:16
Wondron 13.
03:14:16 - 03:14:18
On the doctrine of poisons.
03:14:18 - 03:14:23
So many things have to come together for scientific thinking to originate, and all these necessary
03:14:23 - 03:14:28
strengths had to be invented, practiced, and cultivated separately.
03:14:28 - 03:14:32
As long as they were still separate, however, they frequently had an altogether different
03:14:32 - 03:14:37
effect than they do now that they are integrated into scientific thinking and hold each other
03:14:37 - 03:14:39
in check.
03:14:39 - 03:14:42
Their effect was that of poisons.
03:14:42 - 03:14:48
For example, that of the impulse to doubt, to negate, to wait, to collect, to dissolve.
03:14:48 - 03:14:53
Many hecatombs of human beings were sacrificed before these impulses learned to comprehend
03:14:53 - 03:14:59
their coexistence and to feel that they were all functions of one organizing force within
03:14:59 - 03:15:01
one human being.
03:15:01 - 03:15:07
And even now the time seems remote, when artistic energies and the practical wisdom of life
03:15:07 - 03:15:13
will join with scientific thinking to form a higher organic system in relation to which
03:15:13 - 03:15:17
scholars, physicians, artists, and legislators, as we know them at present, would have to
03:15:17 - 03:15:20
look like paltry relics of ancient times.
03:15:20 - 03:15:22
Wondron 14.
03:15:22 - 03:15:25
How far the moral sphere extends.
03:15:25 - 03:15:29
As soon as we see a new image, we immediately construct it with the aid of all our previous
03:15:29 - 03:15:33
experiences depending on the degree of our honesty and justice.
03:15:33 - 03:15:39
All experiences are moral experiences, even in the realm of sense perception.
03:15:39 - 03:15:42
115.
03:15:42 - 03:15:45
The Four Errors.
03:15:45 - 03:15:47
Man has been educated by his errors.
03:15:47 - 03:15:50
First, he always saw himself only incompletely.
03:15:50 - 03:15:53
Second, he endowed himself with fictitious attributes.
03:15:53 - 03:15:58
Third, he placed himself in a false order of rank in relation to animals and nature.
03:15:58 - 03:16:03
Fourth, he invented ever new tables of goods and always accepted them for a time as eternal
03:16:03 - 03:16:05
and unconditional.
03:16:05 - 03:16:11
As a result of this, now one and now another, human impulse and state held first place and
03:16:11 - 03:16:15
was ennobled because it was esteemed so highly.
03:16:15 - 03:16:21
If we remove the effects of these four errors, we should also remove humanity, humanness,
03:16:21 - 03:16:23
and human dignity.
03:16:23 - 03:16:26
116.
03:16:26 - 03:16:27
Herd Instinct.
03:16:27 - 03:16:30
Wherever we encounter immorality, we also encounter value.
03:16:29 - 03:16:32
and an order of rank of human impulses and actions.
03:16:32 - 03:16:35
These valuations and orders of rank are always expressions
03:16:35 - 03:16:37
of the needs of a community and herd.
03:16:37 - 03:16:41
Whatever benefits it most, and second most and third most,
03:16:41 - 03:16:43
that is also considered the first standard
03:16:43 - 03:16:46
for the value of all individuals.
03:16:46 - 03:16:50
Morality trains the individual to be a function of the herd
03:16:50 - 03:16:53
and to ascribe value to himself only as a function.
03:16:53 - 03:16:55
The conditions for the preservation
03:16:55 - 03:16:57
of different communities were very different,
03:16:57 - 03:17:00
hence there were very different moralities.
03:17:00 - 03:17:03
Considering essential changes in the forms
03:17:03 - 03:17:07
of future herds and communities, states and societies,
03:17:07 - 03:17:08
we can prophesy that there will yet
03:17:08 - 03:17:11
be very divergent moralities.
03:17:11 - 03:17:14
Morality is herd instinct in the individual.
03:17:15 - 03:17:18
117, herd remorse.
03:17:19 - 03:17:22
During the longest and most remote periods
03:17:22 - 03:17:24
of the human past, the sting of conscience
03:17:24 - 03:17:26
was not at all what it is now.
03:17:26 - 03:17:29
Today, one feels responsible only for one's will
03:17:29 - 03:17:33
and actions, and one finds one's pride in oneself.
03:17:34 - 03:17:37
All our teachers of law start from this sense
03:17:37 - 03:17:39
of self and pleasure in the individual
03:17:39 - 03:17:41
as if this had always been the fount of law.
03:17:42 - 03:17:45
But during the longest period of the human past,
03:17:45 - 03:17:47
nothing was more terrible than to feel
03:17:47 - 03:17:49
that one stood by oneself.
03:17:49 - 03:17:53
To be alone, to experience things by oneself,
03:17:53 - 03:17:57
neither to obey nor to rule, to be an individual,
03:17:57 - 03:17:59
that was not a pleasure but a punishment.
03:17:59 - 03:18:01
One was sentenced to individuality.
03:18:03 - 03:18:06
Freedom of thought was considered discomfort itself.
03:18:06 - 03:18:08
While we experience law and submission
03:18:08 - 03:18:11
as compulsion and loss, it was egoism
03:18:11 - 03:18:14
that was formerly experienced as something painful
03:18:14 - 03:18:16
and as real misery.
03:18:16 - 03:18:19
To be a self and to esteem oneself
03:18:19 - 03:18:21
according to one's own weight and measure,
03:18:21 - 03:18:24
that offended taste in those days.
03:18:24 - 03:18:27
An inclination to do this would have been considered madness
03:18:27 - 03:18:31
for being alone was associated with every misery and fear.
03:18:31 - 03:18:35
In those days, free will was very closely associated
03:18:35 - 03:18:37
with a bad conscience.
03:18:37 - 03:18:39
And the more unfree one's actions were
03:18:39 - 03:18:41
and the more the herd instinct,
03:18:41 - 03:18:42
rather than any personal sense,
03:18:42 - 03:18:46
found expression in an action, the more moral one felt.
03:18:46 - 03:18:49
Whatever harmed the herd, whether the individual
03:18:49 - 03:18:51
had wanted it or not wanted it,
03:18:51 - 03:18:55
prompted the sting of conscience in the individual
03:18:55 - 03:18:58
and in his neighbor, too, and even in the whole herd.
03:18:59 - 03:19:00
There is no point on which we have learned
03:19:00 - 03:19:02
to think and feel more differently.
03:19:03 - 03:19:04
118.

Yidot follows necessity,
03:19:13 - 03:19:16
for it strives for superabundant substitutes
03:19:16 - 03:19:18
and wants to regenerate itself.
03:19:18 - 03:19:21
Hence, we should make a distinction in benevolence
03:19:21 - 03:19:23
between the impulse to appropriate
03:19:23 - 03:19:25
and the impulse to submit,
03:19:25 - 03:19:27
and ask whether it is the stronger or the weaker
03:19:27 - 03:19:29
that feels benevolent.
03:19:29 - 03:19:32
Joy and desire appear together in the stronger
03:19:32 - 03:19:35
that wants to transform something into a function.
03:19:35 - 03:19:37
Joy and the wish to be desired
03:19:37 - 03:19:39
appear together in the weaker
03:19:39 - 03:19:41
that wants to become a function.
03:19:41 - 03:19:43
Pity is essentially of the former type,
03:19:43 - 03:19:47
an agreeable impulse of the instinct for appropriation
03:19:47 - 03:19:49
at the sight of what is weaker.
03:19:49 - 03:19:52
But it should be kept in mind that strong and weak
03:19:52 - 03:19:53
are relative concepts.
03:19:54 - 03:19:55
119.
03:19:58 - 03:19:59
No altruism.
03:20:00 - 03:20:03
In many people, I find an overwhelmingly forceful
03:20:03 - 03:20:05
and pleasurable desire to be a function.
03:20:05 - 03:20:08
They have a very refined sense for all those places
03:20:08 - 03:20:10
where precisely they could function
03:20:10 - 03:20:12
and push in those directions.
03:20:12 - 03:20:15
Examples include those women who transform themselves
03:20:15 - 03:20:17
into some function of a man
03:20:17 - 03:20:20
that happens to be underdeveloped in him
03:20:20 - 03:20:22
and thus become his purse or his politics
03:20:22 - 03:20:24
or his sociability.
03:20:24 - 03:20:27
Such beings preserve themselves best
03:20:27 - 03:20:30
when they find a fitting place in another organism.
03:20:30 - 03:20:33
If they fail to do this, they become grumpy,
03:20:33 - 03:20:35
irritated, and devour themselves.
03:20:36 - 03:20:37
120.
03:20:39 - 03:20:40
Health of the soul.
03:20:42 - 03:20:44
The popular medical formulation of morality
03:20:44 - 03:20:46
that goes back to Ariston of Chios,
03:20:46 - 03:20:48
virtue is the health of the soul,
03:20:48 - 03:20:51
would have to be changed to become useful,
03:20:51 - 03:20:55
at least to read, your virtue is the health of your soul.
03:20:56 - 03:20:58
For there is no health as such,
03:20:58 - 03:21:00
and all attempts to define a thing that way
03:21:00 - 03:21:02
have been wretched failures.
03:21:02 - 03:21:05
Even the determination of what is healthy for your body
03:21:05 - 03:21:08
depends on your goal, your horizon,
03:21:08 - 03:21:11
your energies, your impulses, your errors,
03:21:11 - 03:21:15
and above all on the ideals and phantasms of your soul.
03:21:15 - 03:21:18
Thus there are innumerable hilts of the body,
03:21:18 - 03:21:21
and the more we allow the eunuchy and incomparable
03:21:21 - 03:21:22
to raise its head again,
03:21:22 - 03:21:26
and the more we abjure the dogma of the equality of men,
03:21:26 - 03:21:29
the more must the concept of a normal health,
03:21:29 - 03:21:30
along with a normal diet
03:21:30 - 03:21:32
and the normal course of an illness,
03:21:32 - 03:21:35
be abandoned by medical men.
03:21:35 - 03:21:37
Only then would the time have come to reflect
03:21:37 - 03:21:39
on the health and illness of the soul
03:21:39 - 03:21:42
and to find the peculiar virtue of each man
03:21:42 - 03:21:44
in the health of his soul.
03:21:44 - 03:21:45
In one person, of course,
03:21:45 - 03:21:48
this health could look like its opposite in another person.
03:21:49 - 03:21:52
Finally, the great question would still remain
03:21:52 - 03:21:54
whether we can really dispense with illness,
03:21:54 - 03:21:57
even for the sake of our virtue,
03:21:57 - 03:21:59
and whether our thirst for knowledge and self-knowledge
03:21:59 - 03:22:02
in particular does not require the sick soul
03:22:02 - 03:22:03
as much as the healthy,
03:22:03 - 03:22:07
and whether in brief, the will to health alone
03:22:07 - 03:22:09
is not a prejudice, cowardice,
03:22:10 - 03:22:13
and perhaps a bit of very subtle barbarism and backwardness.
03:22:14 - 03:22:15
121.
03:22:17 - 03:22:18
Life, no argument.
03:22:19 - 03:22:22
We have arranged for ourselves a world in which we can live
03:22:22 - 03:22:26
by positing bodies, lines, planes, causes and effects,
03:22:26 - 03:22:29
motion and rest, form and content.
03:22:29 - 03:22:31
Without these articles of faith,
03:22:31 - 03:22:33
nobody now could endure life,
03:22:33 - 03:22:35
but that does not prove them.
03:22:35 - 03:22:37
Life is no argument.
03:22:37 - 03:22:39
The conditions of life might include error.
03:22:41 - 03:22:42
122.
03:22:44 - 03:22:47
Moral skepticism in Christianity.
03:22:47 - 03:22:49
Christianity too has made a great contribution
03:22:49 - 03:22:52
to the enlightenment and taught moral skepticism
03:22:52 - 03:22:54
very trenchantly and effectively,
03:22:54 - 03:22:56
accusing and embittering men,
03:22:56 - 03:22:59
yet with untiring patience and subtlety.
03:22:59 - 03:23:02
It destroyed the faith in his virtues
03:23:02 - 03:23:04
in every single individual.
03:23:04 - 03:23:06
It led to the disappearance from the face of the earth
03:23:07 - 03:23:08
of all those paragons,
03:23:08 - 03:23:12
a virtue of whom there was no dearth in antiquity.
03:23:12 - 03:23:14
Those popular personalities who imbued with faith
03:23:14 - 03:23:16
in their own perfection,
03:23:16 - 03:23:19
went about with the dignity of a great matador.
03:23:19 - 03:23:22
When we today, trained in this Christian school
03:23:22 - 03:23:26
of skepticism, read the moral treatises of the ancients,
03:23:26 - 03:23:28
for example, Seneca and Epictetus,
03:23:28 - 03:23:31
we have a diverting sense of superiority
03:23:31 - 03:23:34
and feel full of secret insights and oversights.
03:23:34 - 03:23:36
We feel as embarrassed as if a child
03:23:36 - 03:23:38
were talking before an old man,
03:23:38 - 03:23:42
or an overenthusiastic young beauty before La Rochefoucauld.
03:23:42 - 03:23:44
We know better what virtue is.
03:23:44 - 03:23:47
In the end, however, we have applied this same skepticism
03:23:47 - 03:23:50
also to all religious states and processes,
03:23:50 - 03:23:55
such as sin, repentance, grace, sanctification,
03:23:55 - 03:23:58
and we have allowed the worm to dig so deep
03:23:58 - 03:24:01
that now we have the same sense of subtle superiority
03:24:01 - 03:24:04
and insight when we read any Christian book.
03:24:04 - 03:24:06
We also know religious feelings better,
03:24:06 - 03:24:09
and it is high time to know them well
03:24:09 - 03:24:11
and to describe them well,
03:24:11 - 03:24:14
for the pious people of the old faith are dying out too.
03:24:14 - 03:24:16
Let us save their image and their type
03:24:16 - 03:24:17
at least for knowledge.
03:24:18 - 03:24:23
123, knowledge is more than a mere means.
03:24:24 - 03:24:27
Without this new passion, I mean the passion to know,
03:24:27 - 03:24:29
science would still be promoted.
03:24:29 - 03:24:31
After all, science has grown and matured
03:24:31 - 03:24:33
without it until now.
03:24:33 - 03:24:36
The good faith in science, the prejudice in its favor
03:24:36 - 03:24:38
that dominates the modern state,
03:24:38 - 03:24:41
and formerly dominated even the church,
03:24:41 - 03:24:42
is actually based on the fact
03:24:42 - 03:24:45
that this unconditional urge and passion
03:24:45 - 03:24:47
has manifested itself so rarely,
03:24:47 - 03:24:50
and that science is considered not a passion,
03:24:50 - 03:24:53
but a mere condition or an ethos.
03:24:53 - 03:24:57
Often mere amour-plaisir of knowledge, curiosity,
03:24:57 - 03:24:59
is felt to be quite sufficient,
03:24:59 - 03:25:02
or amour-vanité, being accustomed to it
03:25:02 - 03:25:05
with the ulterior motive of honors and sustenance.
03:25:05 - 03:25:07
For many people, it is actually quite enough
03:25:07 - 03:25:09
that they have too much leisure
03:25:09 - 03:25:11
and do not know what to do with it,
03:25:11 - 03:25:16
except to read, collect, arrange, observe, and recount.
03:25:16 - 03:25:19
Their scientific impulse is their boredom.
03:25:20 - 03:25:24
Pope Leothex once sang the praises of science
03:25:24 - 03:25:26
in his brief to Berualdo.
03:25:26 - 03:25:28
He called it the most beautiful ornament
03:25:28 - 03:25:30
and the greatest pride of our life,
03:25:30 - 03:25:32
and a noble occupation in times of happiness
03:25:32 - 03:25:34
as well as unhappiness.
03:25:34 - 03:25:36
And finally, he said,
03:25:36 - 03:25:37
without it all, human endeavors
03:25:37 - 03:25:40
would lack any firm foothold,
03:25:40 - 03:25:43
and even with it, things are changeable and insecure enough.
03:25:43 - 03:25:47
But this tolerably skeptical pope keeps silent,
03:25:47 - 03:25:50
like all other ecclesiastical eulogists of science,
03:25:50 - 03:25:52
about his ultimate judgment.
03:25:52 - 03:25:55
From his words, one might infer,
03:25:55 - 03:25:56
although this is strange enough
03:25:56 - 03:25:57
for such a friend of the arts,
03:25:57 - 03:26:00
that he places science above art.
03:26:00 - 03:26:03
But in the end, it is nothing but good manners
03:26:03 - 03:26:05
when he does not speak at this point
03:26:05 - 03:26:08
of what he places high above all of the sciences too,
03:26:08 - 03:26:13
revealed truth, and the eternal salvation of the soul.
03:26:13 - 03:26:17
Compared to that, what are ornaments, pride, entertainment,
03:26:17 - 03:26:20
and the security of life to him?
03:26:20 - 03:26:22
Science is something second class,
03:26:22 - 03:26:25
not anything ultimate, unconditional,
03:26:25 - 03:26:27
not an object of passion.
03:26:28 - 03:26:30
This judgment Leo retained in his soul,
03:26:30 - 03:26:34
the truly Christian judgment about science.
03:26:34 - 03:26:36
In antiquity, the dignity and recognition of science
03:26:36 - 03:26:38
were diminished by the fact
03:26:38 - 03:26:40
that even her most zealous disciples
03:26:40 - 03:26:42
placed the striving for virtue first,
03:26:42 - 03:26:45
and one felt that knowledge had received the highest praise
03:26:45 - 03:26:49
when one celebrated it as the best means to virtue.
03:26:49 - 03:26:51
It is something new in history
03:26:51 - 03:26:53
that knowledge wants to be more than a mere means.
03:26:54 - 03:26:55
124.
03:26:58 - 03:26:59
In the horizon of the infinite.
03:27:01 - 03:27:03
We have left the land and have embarked.
03:27:03 - 03:27:05
We have burned our bridges behind us.
03:27:05 - 03:27:07
Indeed, we have gone farther
03:27:07 - 03:27:09
and destroyed the land behind us.
03:27:09 - 03:27:11
Now, little ship, look out.
03:27:11 - 03:27:13
Beside you is the ocean.
03:27:13 - 03:27:15
To be sure, it does not always roar,
03:27:15 - 03:27:18
and at times it lies spread out like silk and gold
03:27:18 - 03:27:20
and reveries of graciousness.
03:27:20 - 03:27:22
But hours will come when you will realize
03:27:22 - 03:27:23
that it is infinite
03:27:23 - 03:27:27
and that there is nothing more awesome than infinity.
03:27:27 - 03:27:29
Oh, the poor bird that felt free
03:27:29 - 03:27:32
and now strikes the walls of this cage.
03:27:32 - 03:27:34
Whoa, when you feel homesick for the land
03:27:34 - 03:27:36
as if it had offered more freedom
03:27:36 - 03:27:38
and there is no longer any land.
03:27:39 - 03:27:41
125.
03:27:42 - 03:27:44
The madman.
03:27:44 - 03:27:46
Have you not heard of that madman
03:27:46 - 03:27:48
who lit a lantern in the bright morning hours,
03:27:48 - 03:27:51
ran to the marketplace and cried incessantly,
03:27:51 - 03:27:54
I seek God, I seek God.
03:27:55 - 03:27:57
As many of those who did not believe in God
03:27:57 - 03:27:59
were standing around just then,
03:27:59 - 03:28:01
he provoked much laughter.
03:28:01 - 03:28:02
Has he got lost?
03:28:02 - 03:28:04
Asked one.
03:28:04 - 03:28:06
Did he lose his way like a child?
03:28:06 - 03:28:07
Asked another.
03:28:07 - 03:28:08
Or is he hiding?
03:28:08 - 03:28:10
Is he afraid of us?
03:28:10 - 03:28:13
Has he gone on a voyage, emigrated?
03:28:13 - 03:28:16
Thus they yelled and laughed.
03:28:16 - 03:28:17
The madman jumped into their midst
03:28:17 - 03:28:19
and pierced them with his eyes.
03:28:19 - 03:28:22
Wither is God, he cried.
03:28:22 - 03:28:25
I will tell you, we have killed him, you and I.
03:28:25 - 03:28:27
All of us are his murderers.
03:28:27 - 03:28:29
But how did we do this?
03:28:29 - 03:28:31
How could we drink up the sea?
03:28:31 - 03:28:34
Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon?
03:28:34 - 03:28:36
What were we doing when we unchained
03:28:36 - 03:28:38
this earth from its sun?
03:28:38 - 03:28:40
Wither is it moving now?
03:28:40 - 03:28:41
Wither are we moving?
03:28:41 - 03:28:43
Away from all suns?
03:28:43 - 03:28:45
Are we not plunging continually,
03:28:45 - 03:28:48
backward, sideward, forward in all directions?
03:28:48 - 03:28:51
Is there still any up or down?
03:28:51 - 03:28:54
Are we not straying as through an infinite nothing?
03:28:54 - 03:28:56
Do we not feel the breath of empty space?
03:28:56 - 03:28:58
Has it not become colder?
03:28:58 - 03:29:01
Is not night continually closing in on us?
03:29:01 - 03:29:04
Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning?
03:29:04 - 03:29:05
Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise
03:29:05 - 03:29:08
of the gravediggers who are burying God?
03:29:08 - 03:29:12
Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition?
03:29:12 - 03:29:14
Gods too decompose.
03:29:14 - 03:29:15
God is dead.
03:29:15 - 03:29:17
God remains dead.
03:29:17 - 03:29:19
And we have killed him.
03:29:20 - 03:29:21
How shall we comfort ourselves,
03:29:21 - 03:29:23
the murderers of all murderers?
03:29:23 - 03:29:25
What was holiest and mightiest of all
03:29:25 - 03:29:27
that the world has yet owned
03:29:27 - 03:29:29
has bled to death under our knives.
03:29:29 - 03:29:31
Who will wipe this blood off us?
03:29:31 - 03:29:34
What water is there for us to clean ourselves?
03:29:34 - 03:29:36
What festivals of atonement?
03:29:36 - 03:29:39
What sacred games shall we have to invent?
03:29:39 - 03:29:42
Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us?
03:29:42 - 03:29:44
Must we ourselves not become gods
03:29:44 - 03:29:46
simply to appear worthy of it?
03:29:47 - 03:29:49
There has never been a greater deed.
03:29:49 - 03:29:51
And whoever is born after us,
03:29:51 - 03:29:53
for the sake of this deed,
03:29:53 - 03:29:55
he will belong to a higher history
03:29:55 - 03:29:57
than all history hitherto.
03:29:57 - 03:29:59
Here the madman fell silent
03:29:59 - 03:30:01
and looked again at his listeners.
03:30:01 - 03:30:03
And they too were silent
03:30:03 - 03:30:06
and stared at him in astonishment.
03:30:06 - 03:30:08
At last he threw his lantern on the ground
03:30:08 - 03:30:11
and it broke into pieces and went out.
03:30:11 - 03:30:13
I have come too early, he said then.
03:30:13 - 03:30:15
My time is not yet.
03:30:15 - 03:30:17
This tremendous event is still on its way,
03:30:17 - 03:30:18
still wandering.
03:30:18 - 03:30:21
It has not yet reached the ears of men.
03:30:21 - 03:30:24
Lightning and thunder require time.
03:30:24 - 03:30:27
The light of the stars requires time.
03:30:27 - 03:30:29
Deeds though done still require time
03:30:29 - 03:30:31
to be seen and heard.
03:30:31 - 03:30:34
This deed is still more distant from them
03:30:34 - 03:30:36
than the most distant stars.
03:30:36 - 03:30:38
And yet they have done it themselves.
03:30:39 - 03:30:41
It has been related further that on the same day
03:30:41 - 03:30:44
the madman forsaid his way into several churches
03:30:44 - 03:30:47
and there struck up his Requiem Aeternum Deoled out
03:30:47 - 03:30:48
and call it to account,
03:30:48 - 03:30:51
he is said always to have replied nothing but,
03:30:51 - 03:30:53
what after all are these churches now
03:30:53 - 03:30:56
if they are not the tombs and sepulchres of God?
03:30:57 - 03:30:59
Ophirn 26.
03:31:00 - 03:31:02
Mystical explanations.
03:31:02 - 03:31:05
Mystical explanations are considered deep.
03:31:05 - 03:31:08
The truth is that they are not even superficial.
03:31:09 - 03:31:10
127.
03:31:11 - 03:31:15
After effects of the most ancient religiosity.
03:31:15 - 03:31:17
Every thoughtless person supposes
03:31:17 - 03:31:19
that will alone is effective,
03:31:19 - 03:31:21
that willing is something simple,
03:31:21 - 03:31:26
a brute datum, underrivable and intelligible by itself.
03:31:26 - 03:31:28
He is convinced that when he does something,
03:31:28 - 03:31:30
strike something for example,
03:31:30 - 03:31:31
it is he that strikes
03:31:31 - 03:31:35
and that he did strike because he willed it.
03:31:35 - 03:31:37
He does not see any problem here.
03:31:37 - 03:31:40
The feeling of will seems sufficient to him,
03:31:40 - 03:31:42
not only for the assumption of cause and effect,
03:31:42 - 03:31:43
but also for the faith
03:31:43 - 03:31:46
that he understands their relationship.
03:31:46 - 03:31:49
He knows nothing of the mechanism of what happened
03:31:49 - 03:31:50
and of the hundredfold fine work
03:31:50 - 03:31:53
that needs to be done to bring about the strike
03:31:53 - 03:31:56
or of the incapacity of the will in itself
03:31:56 - 03:31:59
to do even the tiniest part of this work.
03:31:59 - 03:32:02
The will is for him, a magically effective force.
03:32:02 - 03:32:05
The faith in the will as the cause of effects
03:32:05 - 03:32:08
is the faith in magically effective forces.
03:32:08 - 03:32:10
Now man believed originally
03:32:10 - 03:32:12
that wherever he saw something happen,
03:32:12 - 03:32:15
a will had to be at work in the background as a cause
03:32:15 - 03:32:18
and a personal willing being.
03:32:18 - 03:32:21
Any notion of mechanics was far from his mind.
03:32:21 - 03:32:24
But since man believed for immense periods of time,
03:32:24 - 03:32:27
only in persons and not in substances,
03:32:27 - 03:32:30
forces, things and so forth,
03:32:30 - 03:32:32
the faith in cause and effect became for him
03:32:32 - 03:32:36
the basic faith that he applies wherever anything happens.
03:32:36 - 03:32:39
And this is what he still does instinctively.
03:32:39 - 03:32:42
It is an atavism of the most ancient origin.
03:32:42 - 03:32:46
The propositions, no effect without a cause,
03:32:46 - 03:32:48
every effect in turn a cause,
03:32:48 - 03:32:52
appear as generalizations of much more limited propositions.
03:32:52 - 03:32:54
No affecting without willing.
03:32:54 - 03:32:57
One can have an effect only on beings that will.
03:32:57 - 03:32:59
No suffering of an effect
03:32:59 - 03:33:02
is ever pure and without consequences,
03:33:02 - 03:33:05
but all suffering consists of an agitation of the will
03:33:05 - 03:33:09
toward action, resistance, revenge, retribution.
03:33:10 - 03:33:12
But in the prehistory of humanity,
03:33:12 - 03:33:16
both sets of propositions were identical.
03:33:16 - 03:33:19
The former were not generalizations of the latter,
03:33:19 - 03:33:23
but the latter were commentaries on the former.
03:33:23 - 03:33:24
When Schopenhauer assumed
03:33:24 - 03:33:27
that all that has being is only a willing,
03:33:27 - 03:33:30
he enthroned a primeval mythology.
03:33:30 - 03:33:32
It seems that he never even attempted an analysis
03:33:32 - 03:33:35
of the will because like everybody else,
03:33:35 - 03:33:38
he had faith in the simplicity and immediacy of all willing
03:33:38 - 03:33:40
while willing is actually a mechanism
03:33:40 - 03:33:42
that is so well-practiced
03:33:42 - 03:33:45
that it all but escapes the observing eye.
03:33:45 - 03:33:48
Against him, I posit these propositions.
03:33:48 - 03:33:52
First, for will to come into being an idea of pleasure
03:33:52 - 03:33:54
and displeasure is needed.
03:33:54 - 03:33:56
Second, when a strong stimulus
03:33:56 - 03:33:59
is experienced as pleasure or displeasure,
03:33:59 - 03:34:01
this depends on the interpretation of the intellect,
03:34:01 - 03:34:03
which to be sure,
03:34:03 - 03:34:04
generally does this work
03:34:04 - 03:34:07
without rising to our consciousness.
03:34:07 - 03:34:09
One in the same stimulus can be interpreted
03:34:09 - 03:34:11
as pleasure or displeasure.
03:34:12 - 03:34:15
Third, it is only in intellectual beings
03:34:15 - 03:34:19
that pleasure, displeasure, and will are to be found.
03:34:19 - 03:34:23
The vast majority of organisms has nothing of the sort.
03:34:23 - 03:34:25
Hephaestus 128.
03:34:27 - 03:34:28
The value of prayer.
03:34:29 - 03:34:31
Prayer has been invented for those people
03:34:31 - 03:34:33
who really never have thoughts of their own
03:34:33 - 03:34:35
and who do not know any elevation of the soul
03:34:35 - 03:34:38
or at least do not notice it when it occurs.
03:34:38 - 03:34:40
What are they to do at sacred sites
03:34:40 - 03:34:43
and in all significant situations in life
03:34:43 - 03:34:47
where calm and some sort of dignity are called for?
03:34:48 - 03:34:51
To keep them at least from disturbing others,
03:34:51 - 03:34:53
the wisdom of all founders of religions,
03:34:53 - 03:34:55
small as well as great,
03:34:55 - 03:34:58
has prescribed to them the formulas of prayers
03:34:58 - 03:35:00
as mechanical work for the lips
03:35:00 - 03:35:01
that take some time
03:35:01 - 03:35:03
and require some exertion of the memory
03:35:03 - 03:35:08
as well as the same fixed posture for hands, feet, and eyes.
03:35:08 - 03:35:10
Let them, like the Tibetans,
03:35:10 - 03:35:13
keep chewing the cud of their om mani padme hum
03:35:13 - 03:35:16
innumerable times or, as in Benares,
03:35:16 - 03:35:18
count the name of the god off their fingers,
03:35:18 - 03:35:22
Ram, Ram, Ram, and so on with or without charm
03:35:22 - 03:35:25
or honor Vishnu with his thousand names
03:35:25 - 03:35:27
or Allah with his 99
03:35:27 - 03:35:30
or let them use prayer mills and rosaries.
03:35:30 - 03:35:33
The main thing is that this work fixes them for a time
03:35:33 - 03:35:36
and makes them tolerable to look at.
03:35:36 - 03:35:37
Their kind of prayer has been invented
03:35:37 - 03:35:39
for the benefit of the pious
03:35:39 - 03:35:43
who do know thoughts and elevations of their own.
03:35:43 - 03:35:45
But even this type has weary hours
03:35:45 - 03:35:48
when a sequence of venerable words and sounds
03:35:48 - 03:35:51
and a pious routine are welcome.
03:35:51 - 03:35:53
But suppose these rare human beings,
03:35:53 - 03:35:57
the religious person, is an exception in every religion,
03:35:57 - 03:35:59
they do not know what to do in such cases.
03:35:59 - 03:36:02
The poor in spirit do not know what to do.
03:36:02 - 03:36:04
And if one forbade them their prayer,
03:36:04 - 03:36:07
rattling one would deprive them of their religion
03:36:07 - 03:36:11
as Protestantism shows us more and more by the day.
03:36:11 - 03:36:13
What religion wants from the masses
03:36:13 - 03:36:15
is no more than that they should keep still
03:36:15 - 03:36:19
with their eyes, hands, legs, and other organs.
03:36:19 - 03:36:21
That way they become more beautiful for a while
03:36:21 - 03:36:24
and look more like human beings.
03:36:25 - 03:36:26
Voivodshire, 129.
03:36:30 - 03:36:32
The conditions for God.
03:36:32 - 03:36:34
God himself cannot exist without wise people,
03:36:34 - 03:36:36
said Luther with good reason.
03:36:36 - 03:36:39
But God can exist even less without unwise people
03:36:39 - 03:36:41
that our good Luther did not say.
03:36:41 - 03:36:42
30.
03:36:44 - 03:36:46
A dangerous resolve.
03:36:46 - 03:36:49
The Christian resolve to find the world ugly and bad
03:36:49 - 03:36:51
has made the world ugly and bad.
03:36:51 - 03:36:52
131.
03:36:57 - 03:36:58
Christianity and suicide.
03:37:00 - 03:37:02
When Christianity came into being,
03:37:02 - 03:37:05
the craving for suicide was immense
03:37:05 - 03:37:08
and Christianity turned it into a lever of its power.
03:37:08 - 03:37:10
It allowed only two kinds of suicide,
03:37:10 - 03:37:13
dress them up with the highest dignity and the highest hopes
03:37:13 - 03:37:17
and forbade all others in a terrifying manner.
03:37:17 - 03:37:19
Only martyrdom and the ascetics slow destruction
03:37:19 - 03:37:21
of his body were permitted.
03:37:22 - 03:37:23
132.
03:37:28 - 03:37:29
Against Christianity.
03:37:32 - 03:37:35
What is now decisive against Christianity is our taste,
03:37:35 - 03:37:36
no longer our reasons.
03:37:38 - 03:37:39
133.
03:37:40 - 03:37:41
Principle.
03:37:42 - 03:37:45
An inescapable hypothesis to which humanity
03:37:45 - 03:37:48
must have recourse again and again
03:37:48 - 03:37:49
is more powerful in the long run
03:37:49 - 03:37:53
than the most firmly believed faith in an untruth,
03:37:53 - 03:37:55
the Christian faith, for example.
03:37:55 - 03:37:59
In the long run, that means in this context 100,000 years.
03:38:00 - 03:38:01
134.
03:38:03 - 03:38:05
Pessimists as victims.
03:38:05 - 03:38:08
Wherever a deep discontent with existence becomes prevalent,
03:38:08 - 03:38:10
it is the aftereffects of some great dietary mistake
03:38:10 - 03:38:12
made by a whole people over a long period of time
03:38:12 - 03:38:14
that are coming to light.
03:38:14 - 03:38:17
Thus the spread of Buddhism, not its origin,
03:38:17 - 03:38:20
depended heavily on the excessive and almost exclusive.
03:38:19 - 03:38:26
reliance of the Indians on rice, which led to a general loss of vigor. Perhaps the modern
03:38:26 - 03:38:30
European discontent is due to the fact that our forefathers were given to drinking through
03:38:30 - 03:38:36
the entire Middle Ages, thanks to the effects on Europe of the Teutonic taste. The Middle
03:38:36 - 03:38:43
Ages meant the alcohol poisoning of Europe. The German discontent with life is essentially
03:38:43 - 03:38:48
a winter sickness that is worsened by the effects of stuffy cellar air and the poison
03:38:48 - 03:38:58
of stove fumes in German living rooms. 135. Origin of sin. Sin, as it is now experienced
03:38:58 - 03:39:05
wherever Christianity holds sway or has held sway, is a Jewish feeling and a Jewish invention.
03:39:05 - 03:39:10
Regarding this background of all Christian morality, Christianity did aim to Judaize
03:39:10 - 03:39:16
the world. How far it has succeeded in Europe is brought out by the fact that Greek antiquity,
03:39:16 - 03:39:22
a world without feelings of sin, still seems so very strange to our sensibility, although
03:39:22 - 03:39:27
whole generations as well as many excellent individuals have expended so much goodwill
03:39:27 - 03:39:33
on attempts to approach and incorporate this world. Only if you repent will God show you
03:39:33 - 03:39:39
grace. That would strike a Greek as ridiculous and annoying. He would say maybe slaves feel
03:39:39 - 03:39:45
that way. The Christian presupposes a powerful, overpowering being who enjoys revenge. His
03:39:45 - 03:39:51
power is so great that nobody could possibly harm him, except for his honor. Every sin
03:39:51 - 03:39:59
is a slight to his honor, a crime in lae sae majestatis divinae, and no more, contrition,
03:39:59 - 03:40:06
degradation, rolling in the dust. All this is the first and last condition of his grace,
03:40:06 - 03:40:12
in sum, the restoration of his divine honor. Whether the sin has done any other harm, whether
03:40:12 - 03:40:17
it has set in motion some profound calamity that will grow and seize one person after
03:40:17 - 03:40:22
another like a disease and strangle them, this honor-craving Oriental in heaven could
03:40:22 - 03:40:29
not care less. Sin is an offense against him, not against humanity. Those who are granted
03:40:29 - 03:40:35
his grace are also granted this carelessness regarding the natural consequences of sin.
03:40:35 - 03:40:42
God and humanity are separated so completely that a sin against humanity is really unthinkable.
03:40:42 - 03:40:47
Every deed is to be considered solely with respect to its supernatural consequences without
03:40:47 - 03:40:52
regard for its natural consequences. That is what Jewish feeling demands, for whatever
03:40:52 - 03:40:58
is natural is considered ignoble. The Greeks, on the other hand, were rather closer to the
03:40:58 - 03:41:05
notion that sacrilege, too, might have some nobility. Even theft, as in the case of Prometheus.
03:41:05 - 03:41:11
Even the slaughter of cattle as the expression of insane envy, as in the case of Ajax. And
03:41:11 - 03:41:17
in their desire to invent some dignity for sacrilege and to incorporate nobility in it,
03:41:17 - 03:41:22
they invented tragedy, an art form and a pleasure that have remained essentially and profoundly
03:41:22 - 03:41:29
foreign to the Jew, in spite of all his poetic gifts and his sense for the sublime.
03:41:29 - 03:41:37
136. The Chosen People. The Jews, who feel that they are the chosen
03:41:37 - 03:41:42
people among all the nations because they are the moral genius among the nations, because
03:41:42 - 03:41:48
they had a more profound contempt for the human being in themselves than any other people.
03:41:48 - 03:41:52
The Jews' enjoyment of their divine monarch and saint is similar to that which the French
03:41:52 - 03:41:59
nobility derived from Louis V. This nobility had surrendered all of its power and sovereignty
03:41:59 - 03:42:04
and had become contemptible. In order not to feel this, in order to be able to forget
03:42:04 - 03:42:10
this, one required royal splendor, royal authority, and plenitude of power without equal to which
03:42:10 - 03:42:15
only the nobility had access. By virtue of this privilege, one rose to the height of
03:42:15 - 03:42:21
the court, and from that vantage point one saw everything beneath oneself and found it
03:42:21 - 03:42:27
contemptible, and thus one got over an irritable conscience. Thus the tower of the royal power
03:42:27 - 03:42:33
was built ever higher into the clouds, and one did not hold back even the last remaining
03:42:33 - 03:42:45
stones of one's own power. 137. Speaking in a Parable.
03:42:45 - 03:42:50
A test as Christ was possible only in a Jewish landscape, I mean one over which the gloomy
03:42:50 - 03:42:55
and sublime thundercloud of the wrathful Jehovah was brooding continually. Only here was the
03:42:55 - 03:43:01
rare and sudden piercing of the gruesome and perpetual general day-night by a single
03:43:01 - 03:43:08
ray of the sun experienced as if it were a miracle of love and the ray of unmerited grace.
03:43:08 - 03:43:12
Only here could Jesus dream of his rainbow and his ladder to heaven on which God descended
03:43:12 - 03:43:20
to man. Everywhere else good weather and sunshine were considered the rule and everyday occurrences.
03:43:20 - 03:43:25
138. Christ's Error.
03:43:25 - 03:43:29
The founder of Christianity thought that there was nothing of which men suffered more than
03:43:29 - 03:43:34
their sins. That was his error, the error of one who felt that he was without sin and
03:43:34 - 03:43:40
who lacked firsthand experience. Thus his soul grew full of that wonderful and fantastic
03:43:40 - 03:43:46
compassion for a misery that even among his people, who had invented sin, was rarely a
03:43:46 - 03:43:51
very great misery. But the Christians have found a way of vindicating their master since
03:43:51 - 03:43:57
then and of sanctifying his error by making it come true.
03:43:57 - 03:44:02
139. The Color of the Passions.
03:44:02 - 03:44:07
People like St. Paul have an evil eye for the passions. All they know of the passions
03:44:07 - 03:44:13
is what is dirty, disfiguring, and heartbreaking. Hence their idealistic tendency aims at the
03:44:13 - 03:44:19
annihilation of the passions, and they find perfect purity in the divine. Very differently
03:44:19 - 03:44:25
from St. Paul and the Jews, the Greeks directed their idealistic tendency precisely toward
03:44:25 - 03:44:32
the passions and loved, elevated, gilded, and deified them. Evidently passion made them
03:44:32 - 03:44:39
feel not only happier but also purer and more divine. And the Christians? Did they want
03:44:39 - 03:44:43
to become Jews in this respect? Did they perhaps succeed?
03:44:43 - 03:44:48
140. Too Jewish.
03:44:48 - 03:44:52
If God wished to become an object of love, he should have given up judging and justice
03:44:52 - 03:44:59
first of all. A judge, even a merciful judge, is no object of love. The founder of Christianity
03:44:59 - 03:45:05
was not refined enough in his feelings at this point, being a Jew.
03:45:05 - 03:45:09
141. Too Oriental.
03:45:09 - 03:45:14
What? A God who loves men provided only that they believe in him, and who casts an evil
03:45:14 - 03:45:21
eye and threats upon anyone who does not believe in this love? What? A love encapsuled in if-clauses
03:45:21 - 03:45:26
attributed to an Almighty God? A love that has not even mastered the feelings of honor
03:45:26 - 03:45:33
and vindictiveness? How Oriental this is? If I love you, is that your concern? Is a
03:45:33 - 03:45:39
sufficient critique of the whole of Christianity? 142.
03:45:39 - 03:45:46
Frankincense. Buddha says, Do not flatter your benefactor. Repeat this saying in a Christian
03:45:46 - 03:45:54
church. Right away it clears the air of everything Christian. 143.
03:45:54 - 03:45:59
The greatest advantage of polytheism, for an individual to posit his own ideal and to
03:45:59 - 03:46:04
derive from it his own law, joys, and rights, that may well have been considered hitherto
03:46:04 - 03:46:11
as the most outrageous human aberration and as idolatry itself. The few who dared as much
03:46:11 - 03:46:18
always felt the need to apologize to themselves, usually by saying, It was an I, not I, but
03:46:18 - 03:46:26
a God through me. The wonderful art and gift of creating gods, polytheism, was the medium
03:46:26 - 03:46:33
through which this impulse could discharge, purify, perfect, and ennoble itself. For originally
03:46:33 - 03:46:41
it was a very undistinguished impulse, related to stubbornness, disobedience, and envy. Hostility
03:46:41 - 03:46:48
against this impulse to have an ideal of one's own was formerly the central law of all morality.
03:46:48 - 03:46:53
There was only one norm, man, and every people thought that it possessed this one ultimate
03:46:53 - 03:47:00
norm, but above and outside, in some distant overworld, one was permitted to behold a plurality
03:47:00 - 03:47:07
of norms. One God was not considered a denial of another God, nor blasphemy against him.
03:47:07 - 03:47:12
It was here that the luxury of individuals was first permitted. It was here that one
03:47:12 - 03:47:18
first honored the rights of individuals. The invention of gods, heroes, and overmen of
03:47:18 - 03:47:25
all kinds, as well as near-men and under-men, dwarfs, fairies, centaurs, satyrs, demons,
03:47:25 - 03:47:30
and devils, was the inestimable preliminary exercise for the justification of the egoism
03:47:30 - 03:47:36
and sovereignty of the individual. The freedom that one conceded to a god in his relation
03:47:36 - 03:47:43
to other gods, one eventually also granted to oneself in relation to laws, customs, and
03:47:43 - 03:47:48
neighbors. Monotheism, on the other hand, this rigid consequence of the doctrine of
03:47:48 - 03:47:55
one normal human type, the faith in one normal God, beside whom there are only pseudo-gods,
03:47:55 - 03:48:00
was perhaps the greatest danger that has yet confronted humanity. It threatened us with
03:48:00 - 03:48:06
the premature stagnation that, as far as we can see, most other species have long reached,
03:48:06 - 03:48:11
for all of them believe in one normal type and ideal for their species, and they have
03:48:11 - 03:48:18
translated the morality of moors definitively into their own flesh and blood. In polytheism,
03:48:18 - 03:48:22
the free-spiriting and many-spiriting of man attained its first preliminary form,
03:48:22 - 03:48:28
the strength to create for ourselves our own new eyes, and ever again new eyes that are even more,
03:48:28 - 03:48:35
our own. Hence, man alone among all the animals has no eternal horizons and perspectives.
03:48:36 - 03:48:41
144. Religious Wars.
03:48:41 - 03:48:47
Religious war has signified the greatest progress of the masses hitherto, for it proves that the
03:48:47 - 03:48:53
mass has begun to treat concepts with respect. Religious wars start only after the more refined
03:48:53 - 03:48:59
quarrels between sects have refined reason in general to the point where even the mob becomes
03:48:59 - 03:49:04
subtle and takes trifles seriously, and actually considers it possible that the
03:49:04 - 03:49:08
eternal salvation of the soul might hinge on small differences between concepts.
03:49:08 - 03:49:14
145. Danger for Vegetarians.
03:49:14 - 03:49:20
A diet that consists predominantly of rice leads to the use of opium and narcotics,
03:49:20 - 03:49:25
just as a diet that consists predominantly of potatoes leads to the use of liquor. But
03:49:25 - 03:49:30
it also has subtler effects that include ways of thinking and feeling that have narcotic effects.
03:49:30 - 03:49:36
This agrees with the fact that those who promote narcotic ways of thinking and feelings,
03:49:36 - 03:49:42
like some Indian gurus, praise a diet that is entirely vegetarian and would like to impose
03:49:42 - 03:49:48
that as a law upon the masses. In this way they want to create and increase the need that they
03:49:48 - 03:49:49
are in a position to satisfy.
03:49:49 - 03:49:55
146. German Hopes.
03:49:55 - 03:50:01
Let us not forget that names of peoples are usually abusive names. The Tartars,
03:50:01 - 03:50:06
for example, are literally the dogs. That is what the Chinese called them. Germans
03:50:06 - 03:50:13
originally meant heathen. That is what the Goths, after their conversion, called the great mass of
03:50:13 - 03:50:18
their unbaptized kindred tribes, in accordance with their translation of the Septuagint,
03:50:18 - 03:50:24
which uses for the heathen the word that in Greek means the nations. See Ulphilas.
03:50:24 - 03:50:30
It is not too late for the Germans to turn their abusive name into a name of honor by
03:50:30 - 03:50:36
becoming the first unchristian nation in Europe. Schopenhauer gave them credit for having very
03:50:36 - 03:50:41
pronounced predispositions in that direction. That would be a way of fulfilling the words of
03:50:41 - 03:50:46
Luther, who taught them to be un-Roman and to say, Here I stand, I cannot do otherwise.
03:50:46 - 03:50:52
147. Question and Answer.
03:50:52 - 03:51:00
What is it that savage tribes today accept first of all from Europeans? Liquor and Christianity,
03:51:00 - 03:51:07
the European narcotics. And of what do they perish most quickly? Of the European narcotics.
03:51:08 - 03:51:13
148. Where Reformations Occur.
03:51:13 - 03:51:20
At the time when the church was most corrupt, the church in Germany was least corrupt. That
03:51:20 - 03:51:24
is why the Reformation occurred here, showing that here even the beginnings of corruption were
03:51:24 - 03:51:31
felt to be intolerable. Relatively speaking, no people has ever been more Christian than the
03:51:31 - 03:51:36
Germans of Luther's time. Their Christian civilization was ready to burst into hundreds
03:51:36 - 03:51:41
of blossoms. Only one more night was needed. But this night brought the storm that put an
03:51:41 - 03:51:49
end to everything. 149. The Failure of Reformations.
03:51:49 - 03:51:55
Among the Greeks, several attempts to found new Greek religions failed, which speaks for the
03:51:55 - 03:52:00
higher civilization of the Greeks even in rather early times. It suggests that there must have
03:52:00 - 03:52:06
been in Greece at an early time large numbers of diverse individuals whose diverse needs and
03:52:06 - 03:52:10
miseries could not be taken care of with a single prescription of faith and hope.
03:52:10 - 03:52:17
Pythagoras and Plato, perhaps also Empedocles, and much earlier yet the Orphic enthusiasts,
03:52:17 - 03:52:23
aimed to found new religions. And the first two had souls and talents that fitted them so
03:52:23 - 03:52:28
obviously for the role of religious founders that one can scarcely marvel enough that they
03:52:28 - 03:52:34
should have failed. Yet all they managed to found were sex. Whenever the reformation of a
03:52:34 - 03:52:39
whole people fails, and it is only sex that elevate their leader, we may conclude that
03:52:39 - 03:52:45
the people has become relatively heterogeneous and has begun to move away from rude herd instincts
03:52:45 - 03:52:51
and the morality of mores. They are hovering in an interesting intermediate position that
03:52:51 - 03:52:57
is usually dismissed as a mere decay of morals and corruption, although in fact it proclaims
03:52:57 - 03:53:01
that the egg is approaching maturity and that the eggshell is about to be broken.
03:53:01 - 03:53:07
That Luther's reformation succeeded in the North suggests that the North of Europe was
03:53:07 - 03:53:13
retarded compared to the South and still knew only rather homogeneous and monotonous needs. Indeed,
03:53:13 - 03:53:19
Europe would never have become Christian in the first place if the culture of the ancient world
03:53:19 - 03:53:24
in the South had not gradually been barbarized through an excessive admixture of Teutonic
03:53:24 - 03:53:30
barbarian blood, thus losing its cultural superiority. The more general and unconditional
03:53:30 - 03:53:36
the influence of an individual or the idea of an individual can be, the more homogeneous and the
03:53:36 - 03:53:42
lower must the mass be that is influenced, while counter movements give evidence of counter needs
03:53:42 - 03:53:48
that also want to be satisfied and recognized. Conversely, we may always infer that a civilization
03:53:48 - 03:53:53
is really high when powerful and domineering natures have little influence and create only
03:53:54 - 03:54:00
sex. This applies also to the various arts and the field of knowledge. Where someone rules,
03:54:00 - 03:54:06
there are masses, and where we find masses, we also find a need to be enslaved. Where men are
03:54:06 - 03:54:10
enslaved, there are few individuals, and these are opposed by herd instincts and conscience.
03:54:10 - 03:54:15
150. On the Critique of Saints.
03:54:18 - 03:54:22
To have a virtue must one really wish to have it in its most brutal form,
03:54:22 - 03:54:28
as the Christian saints wished and needed it? They could endure life only by thinking that
03:54:28 - 03:54:33
the sight of their virtue would engender self-contempt in anyone who saw them. But
03:54:33 - 03:54:41
a virtue with that effect I call brutal. 151. Of the Origin of Religion.
03:54:41 - 03:54:46
The metaphysical need is not the origin of religions, as Schopenhauer supposed,
03:54:46 - 03:54:52
but merely a late offshoot. Under the rule of religious ideas, one has become accustomed to
03:54:52 - 03:54:59
the notion of another world, behind, below, above. And when religious ideas are destroyed,
03:54:59 - 03:55:04
one is troubled by an uncomfortable emptiness and deprivation. From this feeling grows once
03:55:04 - 03:55:11
again another world, but now merely a metaphysical one that is no longer religious. But what first
03:55:11 - 03:55:18
led to the positing of another world in primeval times was not some impulse or need, but an error
03:55:18 - 03:55:22
in the interpretation of certain natural events, a failure of the intellect.
03:55:23 - 03:55:27
152. The Greatest Change.
03:55:28 - 03:55:34
The illumination and the color of all things have changed. We no longer understand altogether how
03:55:34 - 03:55:39
the ancients experienced what was most familiar and frequent, for example the day and waking.
03:55:40 - 03:55:44
Since the ancients believed in dreams, waking appeared in a different light.
03:55:45 - 03:55:50
The same goes for the whole of life, which was illumined by death and its significance.
03:55:50 - 03:55:57
For us, death means something quite different. All experiences shone differently because a god
03:55:57 - 03:56:01
shone through them. All decisions and perspectives on the remote future, too,
03:56:02 - 03:56:09
for they had oracles and secret portents, and believed in prophecy. Truth was experienced
03:56:09 - 03:56:14
differently, for the insane could be accepted formerly as its mouthpiece, which makes us
03:56:14 - 03:56:20
shudder or laugh. Every wrong had a different effect on men's feelings, for one feared divine
03:56:20 - 03:56:27
retribution and not merely a civil punishment and dishonor. What was joy in ages when one believed
03:56:27 - 03:56:33
in devils and tempters? What was passion when one saw demons lying in wait nearby? What was
03:56:33 - 03:56:39
philosophy when doubt was experienced as a sin of the most dangerous kind, as sacrilege against
03:56:39 - 03:56:46
eternal love, as mistrust of all that was good, high, pure, and merciful? We have given things
03:56:46 - 03:56:53
a new color, we go on painting them continually. But what do all our efforts to date avail when
03:56:53 - 03:56:57
we hold them against the colored splendor of that old master, ancient humanity?
03:56:58 - 03:57:01
Quotienunrundum 53
03:57:03 - 03:57:10
Homo Poeta I myself, having made this tragedy of tragedies all by myself, insofar as it is finished,
03:57:10 - 03:57:16
I, having first tied the knot of morality into existence before I drew it so tight that only a
03:57:16 - 03:57:23
god could untie it, which is what Horace demands, I myself have now slain all gods in the fourth act
03:57:23 - 03:57:31
for the sake of morality. Now, what is to become of the fifth act? From where am I to take the
03:57:31 - 03:57:39
tragic solition? Should I begin to think about a comic solution? 154
03:57:41 - 03:57:45
Different types of dangerous lives. You have no idea what you are living through.
03:57:45 - 03:57:50
You rush through life as if you were drunken now and then fall down some staircase.
03:57:51 - 03:57:56
But thanks to your drunkenness you never break a limb. Your muscles are too relaxed and your brain
03:57:56 - 03:58:01
too benighted for you to find the stones of these stairs as hard as we do. For us, life is more
03:58:01 - 03:58:09
dangerous. We are made of glass. Woe unto us if we merely bump ourselves, and all is lost if we fall.
03:58:10 - 03:58:11
155
03:58:12 - 03:58:13
Taught her for.
03:58:15 - 03:58:20
What we lack too. We love what is great in nature, and we have discovered this,
03:58:21 - 03:58:26
because in our heads great human beings are lacking. It was the other way around with the
03:58:26 - 03:58:31
Greeks. Their feeling for nature was different from ours. 156
03:58:33 - 03:58:39
Who is most influential? When a human being resists his whole age and stops it at the gate
03:58:39 - 03:58:46
to demand an accounting, this must have influence. Whether that is what he desires is immaterial.
03:58:46 - 03:58:50
That he can do it is what matters. 157
03:58:51 - 03:58:57
Mentiri, watch out! He reflects. In a moment he will be ready with a lie. This is a stage
03:58:57 - 03:59:02
of civilization represented by whole peoples. Just consider what the Romans meant when they
03:59:02 - 03:59:06
used the word mentiri. 158
03:59:09 - 03:59:14
An inconvenient trait. To find everything profound, that is an inconvenient trait. It
03:59:14 - 03:59:19
makes one strain one's eyes all the time, and in the end one finds more than one might have wished.
03:59:20 - 03:59:22
159
03:59:24 - 03:59:29
Every virtue has its age. Anyone who is unyielding nowadays will often have a bad conscience due to
03:59:29 - 03:59:34
his honesty, for being unyielding is a virtue that does not belong to the same age as the
03:59:34 - 03:59:38
virtue of honesty. 160
03:59:39 - 03:59:47
Dealing with virtues. In dealing with a virtue too, one can lack dignity and fawn. 161
03:59:49 - 03:59:55
To those who love the age. The ex-priest and the released criminal keep making faces.
03:59:55 - 04:00:00
What they desire is a face without a past. But have you ever seen people who know that
04:00:00 - 04:00:05
their faces reflect the future, and who are so polite to you who love the age,
04:00:05 - 04:00:09
that they make a face without future? 162
04:00:09 - 04:00:16
Egoism. Egoism is the law of perspective applied to feelings. What is closest appears large
04:00:16 - 04:00:21
and weighty, and as one moves farther away, size and weight decrease.
04:00:21 - 04:00:30
163. After a Great Victory. What is best about a great victory is that it liberates the victor
04:00:30 - 04:00:36
from the fear of defeat. Why not be defeated sometime, too, he says to himself? Now I am
04:00:36 - 04:00:46
rich enough for that. 164. Those Who Seek Rest. The spirits who seek
04:00:46 - 04:00:51
rest I recognize by the many dark objects with which they surround themselves. Those
04:00:51 - 04:00:55
who want to sleep, make their room dark, or crawl into a cave. A hint for those who do
04:00:55 - 04:01:01
not know what it is that they seek most, but who would like to know.
04:01:01 - 04:01:09
165. The Happiness of Those Who Have Renounced Something. If one renounces something thoroughly
04:01:09 - 04:01:13
and for a long time and then accidentally encounters it again, one may almost think
04:01:13 - 04:01:19
that one has discovered it. And how much happiness is there in discovery? Let us be wiser than
04:01:19 - 04:01:25
the serpents who lie too long in the same sunlight.
04:01:25 - 04:01:32
166. Always in Our Company. Whatever in nature and in history is of my own kind, speaks to
04:01:32 - 04:01:38
me, spurs me on, and comforts me. The rest I do not hear or forget right away. We are
04:01:38 - 04:01:48
always only in our own company. 167. Misanthropy and Love. One speaks of being
04:01:48 - 04:01:53
sick of man only when one can no longer digest him and yet has one's stomach.
04:01:53 - 04:02:06
168. Of a Sick Man. He is in a bad way. What is wrong? He is suffering from the desire
04:02:06 - 04:02:12
for praise and does not find nourishment for it. Incredible! All the world is celebrating
04:02:12 - 04:02:19
him and pampering him and he is on everybody's lips. Yes, but his hearing for praise is bad.
04:02:19 - 04:02:23
When a friend praises him, it seems to him as if his friend praised himself. When an
04:02:23 - 04:02:29
enemy praises him, it seems to him as if his enemy expected praise for being so generous.
04:02:29 - 04:02:34
And when he is praised by one of the rest, and there are not that many left over because
04:02:34 - 04:02:38
he is so famous, he feels hurt that some people consider him neither a friend nor an enemy,
04:02:38 - 04:02:42
and he says, what are those to me who make a show of their justice toward me?
04:02:42 - 04:02:53
169. Open Enemies. Courage before the enemy is one thing and does not rule out cowardice or
04:02:53 - 04:02:59
indecisiveness and confusion. That is how Napoleon judged the most courageous person he knew,
04:02:59 - 04:03:05
Murat. It follows that some people need open enemies if they are to rise to the level of
04:03:05 - 04:03:15
their own virtue, virility, and cheerfulness. 170. With the Crowd. So far he is still running
04:03:15 - 04:03:20
with the crowd and singing its praises, but one day he will become its enemy, for he is following
04:03:20 - 04:03:25
it in the belief that this will allow his laziness full scope, and he has not yet found out that the
04:03:25 - 04:03:30
crowd is not lazy enough for him, that it always pushes on, that it never allows anyone to stand
04:03:30 - 04:03:41
still. And he loves to stand still. 171. Fame. When the gratitude of many to one throws away
04:03:41 - 04:03:51
all shame, we behold fame. 172. Spoiling the Taste. A. You keep spoiling the taste, that is
04:03:51 - 04:03:56
what everybody says. B. Certainly. I spoil the taste of his party for everyone, and no party
04:03:56 - 04:04:05
forgives that. 173. Being Profound and Seeming Profound. Those who know that they are profound
04:04:05 - 04:04:11
strive for clarity. Those who would like to seem profound to the crowd strive for obscurity. For
04:04:11 - 04:04:16
the crowd believes that if it cannot see to the bottom of something, it must be profound. It is
04:04:16 - 04:04:29
so timid and dislikes going into the water. 174. Apart. Parliamentarianism, that is public
04:04:29 - 04:04:35
permission to choose between five basic political opinions, flatters and wins the favor of all those
04:04:35 - 04:04:41
who would like to seem independent and individual, as if they fought for their opinions. Ultimately,
04:04:41 - 04:04:46
however, it is indifferent whether the herd is commanded to have one opinion or permitted to have
04:04:46 - 04:04:52
five. Whoever deviates from the five public opinions and stands apart will always have the
04:04:52 - 04:05:01
whole herd against him. 175. Of Eloquence. Who has had the most convincing eloquence so far? The
04:05:01 - 04:05:05
drumroll, and as long as the kings command that, they remain the best orators and rabble-rousers?
04:05:05 - 04:05:07
176.
04:05:11 - 04:05:17
Pity. Poor reigning princes. All of their rights are suddenly changing into claims,
04:05:17 - 04:05:21
and all these claims begin to sound like presumption. Even if they only say,
04:05:21 - 04:05:28
we or my people, malicious old Europe begins to smile. Surely a chief master of ceremonies
04:05:28 - 04:05:32
in the modern world would waste little ceremony on them and might well decree,
04:05:32 - 04:05:45
les souverains rangeant au parvenu. 177. On the educational establishment. In Germany,
04:05:45 - 04:05:48
higher men lack one great means of education, the laughter of higher men,
04:05:48 - 04:05:56
for in Germany these do not laugh. 178. On morale enlightenment. One has to talk the Germans out
04:05:56 - 04:05:59
of their Mephistopheles and their Faust as well. These are two moral prejudices against the value
04:05:59 - 04:06:07
of knowledge. 179. Thoughts. Thoughts are the shadows of our feelings, always darker,
04:06:07 - 04:06:16
emptier, and simpler. 180. A good age for free spirits. Free spirits take liberties even with
04:06:16 - 04:06:21
science, and so far get away with it, as long as the church still stands. To that extent,
04:06:21 - 04:06:30
this is a good age for them. 181. Following and walking ahead. A. Of these two one will
04:06:30 - 04:06:36
always follow, and the other always walk ahead, wherever fate may lead them, and yet the former
04:06:36 - 04:06:43
excels the other one in virtue as well as spirit. B. And yet, and yet, you speak for the benefit of
04:06:43 - 04:06:55
the others, not for me, not for us. Fit. Secondum. Regulum. 182. In solitude. Those who live alone
04:06:55 - 04:06:59
do not speak too loud nor write too loud, for they fear the hollow echo, the critique of the
04:06:59 - 04:07:09
nymph echo. And all voices sound different in solitude. 183. The music of the best future.
04:07:09 - 04:07:16
6. I should account as the foremost musician one who knew only the sadness of the most profound
04:07:16 - 04:07:23
happiness, and no other sadness at all. But such a musician has never existed yet. 184.
04:07:23 - 04:07:31
Justice. I'd sooner have people steal from me than be surrounded by scarecrows and hungry looks.
04:07:31 - 04:07:40
That is my taste. And this is by all means a matter of taste, nothing more. 185. Poor. He is
04:07:40 - 04:07:44
poor today, but not because one has taken everything away from him. He has thrown away
04:07:44 - 04:07:51
everything. What is that to him? He is used to finding things. It is the poor who misunderstand
04:07:51 - 04:08:00
his voluntary poverty. 186. Bad conscience. Everything he is doing now is decent and in
04:08:00 - 04:08:07
order, and yet he has a bad conscience. For the extraordinary in his task. 187.
04:08:11 - 04:08:18
Offensive of presentation. This artist offends me by the manner in which he presents his ideas.
04:08:18 - 04:08:22
Although they are very good, his presentation is so broad and emphatic and depends on such
04:08:22 - 04:08:28
crude artifices of persuasion, as if he addressed a mob. Whenever we give some time to his art,
04:08:28 - 04:08:38
we are soon as if in bad company. 188. Work. How close work and the worker are now,
04:08:38 - 04:08:43
even to the most leisurely among us. The royal courtesy of the saying,
04:08:43 - 04:08:48
we are all workers, would have been cynical and indecent as recently as the reign of Louis XIV.
04:08:48 - 04:08:59
189. The thinker. He is a thinker. That means he knows how to make things simpler than they are.
04:08:59 - 04:09:07
190. Against those who praise. A. One is praised only by one's peers. B. Yes,
04:09:07 - 04:09:15
and whoever praises you says, I am your peer. 191. Against many a defense, the most perfidious
04:09:15 - 04:09:20
way of harming a cause consists of defending it deliberately with faulty arguments.
04:09:20 - 04:09:30
192. The good-natured. What is the difference between those good-natured people whose faces
04:09:30 - 04:09:35
radiate goodwill and other people? They are cheered by the sight of another person and
04:09:35 - 04:09:40
quickly fall in love with him. Therefore they are well disposed toward him, and their first
04:09:40 - 04:09:47
judgment is, I like him. What distinguishes these people is a rapid succession of the
04:09:47 - 04:09:53
following states. The wish to appropriate. They do not scruple over the worth of the other person.
04:09:53 - 04:09:58
Quick appropriation, delight in their new possession, and action for the benefit of,
04:09:58 - 04:10:09
their latest conquist. 193. Kant's joke. Kant wanted to prove, in a way that would dumbfound
04:10:09 - 04:10:16
the common man, that the common man was right. That was the secret joke of this soul. He wrote
04:10:16 - 04:10:21
against the scholars in support of popular prejudice, but for scholars and not for the
04:10:21 - 04:10:31
people. 194. The open-hearted. That person probably always acts in accordance with secret
04:10:31 - 04:10:35
reasons, for he always has communicable reasons on his lips and practically in his open hand.
04:10:35 - 04:10:44
195. Laughable. Look, look, he is running away from people but they follow after him,
04:10:44 - 04:10:47
because he is running ahead of them. They are heard through and through.
04:10:47 - 04:10:58
196. Limits of our hearing. One hears only those questions for which one is able to find answers.
04:10:58 - 04:11:07
197. Better watch out. There is nothing we like so much to communicate to others as the seal of
04:11:07 - 04:11:16
secrecy, along with what lies under it. 198. Chagrin of the proud. The proud feel
04:11:16 - 04:11:20
chagrined even by those who advance them. They are angry with the horses of their carriage.
04:11:20 - 04:11:31
199. Liberality. With the rich, liberality is often merely a kind of shyness.
04:11:31 - 04:11:40
200. Laughter. Laughter means being shot and fro but with a good conscience.
04:11:40 - 04:11:51
201. Applause. In applause there is always a kind of noise, even when we applaud ourselves.
04:11:51 - 04:12:01
202. A squanderer. As yet he does not have the poverty of the rich who have already counted
04:12:01 - 04:12:06
all their treasures once, he is squandering his spirit with the unreason of squandering nature.
04:12:06 - 04:12:16
203. Hickniger. Istouis. 53. Usually he has no thought in his head,
04:12:16 - 04:12:26
but in exceptional cases he has nasty thoughts. 204. Beggars and courtesy. There is no lack of
04:12:26 - 04:12:31
courtesy in using a stone to knock on a door when there is no bell. That is how beggars feel in all
04:12:31 - 04:12:40
who suffer some sort of distress, but nobody agrees with them. 205. Need. Need is considered
04:12:40 - 04:12:45
the cause why something came to be, but in truth it is often merely an effect of what has come to be.
04:12:45 - 04:12:56
206. When it rains. It is raining, and I think of the poor who now huddle together with their
04:12:56 - 04:13:01
many cares and without any practice at concealing these. Each is ready and willing to hurt the other
04:13:01 - 04:13:07
and to create for himself a wretched kind of pleasure, even when the weather is bad. That,
04:13:07 - 04:13:18
and only that, is the poverty of the poor. 207. The Envious. He is envious. Let us hope
04:13:18 - 04:13:22
that he will not have children, for he would envy them, because he cannot be a child any more.
04:13:22 - 04:13:32
208. Great man. From the fact that somebody is a big man, we cannot infer that he is a man. Perhaps
04:13:33 - 04:13:37
he is merely a boy, or a chameleon of all the ages of life, or a bewitched little female.
04:13:37 - 04:13:47
209. One Way of Asking for Reasons. There is a way of asking us for our reasons that leads us
04:13:47 - 04:13:53
not only to forget our best reasons, but also to conceive a stubborn aversion to all reasons. This
04:13:53 - 04:13:57
way of asking makes people very stupid and is a trick used by tyrannical people.
04:13:58 - 04:14:05
210. Moderation in Industriousness. One should not try to excel one's father's
04:14:05 - 04:14:15
industriousness. That makes one sick. 211. Secret Enemies. 54. To be able to afford a
04:14:15 - 04:14:21
secret enemy, that is a luxury for which the morality of even elevated spirits is usually
04:14:21 - 04:14:32
not rich enough. 212. Not to be deceived. His spirit has bad manners, is hasty, and so impatient
04:14:32 - 04:14:37
that it always stutters. Hence one scarcely suspects how long the breath and how broad
04:14:37 - 04:14:47
the chest of the soul are in which this spirit is at home. 213. The Way to Happiness. A sage
04:14:48 - 04:14:52
asked a fool about the way to happiness. The fool answered instantly as if he had merely been asked
04:14:52 - 04:14:59
about the way to the nearest town. Admire yourself and live in the street. No, replied the sage,
04:14:59 - 04:15:05
you're asking too much. It is quite sufficient to admire oneself. The fool shot back, but how can
04:15:05 - 04:15:15
one constantly admire without constantly feeling contempt? 2214. Faith Makes Blessed. Virtue bestows
04:15:15 - 04:15:20
happiness and a kind of bliss only on those who have not lost their faith in their virtue,
04:15:20 - 04:15:26
not on those subtler souls whose virtue consists in a profound mistrust of themselves and of all
04:15:26 - 04:15:33
virtue. Ultimately then, faith makes blessed here too and not, mark it well, virtue.
04:15:33 - 04:15:44
215. Ideal and Material. The ideal you envisage is noble, but are you a noble enough stone to be
04:15:44 - 04:15:51
made into such a divine image? Anyway, is your work not that of a barbarous sculptor? Is it not
04:15:51 - 04:16:02
a blasphemy against your ideal? 216. Danger in the Voice. Anyone with a very loud voice is almost
04:16:02 - 04:16:11
incapable of thinking subtleties. 217. Cause and Effect. Before the effect,
04:16:11 - 04:16:20
one believes in different causes than one does afterward. 218. My Antipathy. I do not love
04:16:20 - 04:16:25
people who have to explode like bombs in order to have any effect at all. When one is near them,
04:16:25 - 04:16:29
one is always in danger of suddenly losing one's hearing, if not more than that.
04:16:29 - 04:16:39
219. The Purpose of Punishment. The purpose of punishment is to improve those who punish,
04:16:39 - 04:16:42
that is the last resort of the apologists for punishment.
04:16:42 - 04:16:52
220. Sacrifice. The sacrificial animal does not share the spectator's ideas about sacrifice,
04:16:52 - 04:17:01
but one has never let it have its say. 221. Consideration. Fathers and sons
04:17:01 - 04:17:04
have much more consideration for each other than mothers and daughters.
04:17:05 - 04:17:14
Utkartsar. 222. Poet and Liar. The poet considers the liar a foster brother whom he did out of his
04:17:14 - 04:17:19
milk. Hence his brother remained weak and wretched, and never even attained a good conscience.
04:17:19 - 04:17:28
223. Vicarious Senses. Our eyes are also intended for hearing, said an old father
04:17:28 - 04:17:33
confessor who had become deaf, and among the blind he that has the longest ears is king.
04:17:33 - 04:17:46
224. Animals as Critics. I fear that the animals consider man as a being like themselves,
04:17:46 - 04:17:52
that has lost in a most dangerous way its sound animal common sense. They consider him the insane
04:17:52 - 04:17:55
animal, the laughing animal, the weeping animal, the miserable animal.
04:17:55 - 04:18:06
225. The Natural. Evil has always had great effects in its favor, and nature is evil,
04:18:06 - 04:18:12
let us therefore be natural. That is the secret reasoning of those who have mastered the most
04:18:12 - 04:18:16
spectacular effects, and they have all too often been considered great human beings.
04:18:17 - 04:18:26
226. Mistrust and Style. We say the strongest things simply, provided only that we are
04:18:26 - 04:18:31
surrounded by people who believe in our strength. Such an environment educates one to attain
04:18:31 - 04:18:39
simplicity of style. The mistrustful speak emphatically, the mistrustful also make others
04:18:39 - 04:18:49
emphatic. 227. Bad Reasoning, Bad Shot. 6. He cannot control himself, and from that a poor
04:18:49 - 04:18:52
woman infers that it will be easy to control him, and casts her net for him. Soon she will be his
04:18:52 - 04:19:02
slave. 228. Against Mediators. Those who want to mediate between two resolute thinkers show that
04:19:02 - 04:19:08
they are mediocre. They lack eyes for seeing what is unique. Seeing things as similar and
04:19:08 - 04:19:19
making things the same is the sign of weak eyes. 229. Obstinacy and Faithfulness. Obstinately he
04:19:19 - 04:19:25
clings to something that he has come to see through, but he calls it faithfulness. 230.
04:19:25 - 04:19:32
Dirt of Silence. His whole nature fails to persuade. That is because he has never remained
04:19:32 - 04:19:43
silent about any of his good deeds. 231. The Thorough. Those who are slow to know suppose
04:19:43 - 04:19:54
that slowness is of the essence of knowledge. 232. Dreams. Either we have no dreams, or our
04:19:54 - 04:20:00
dreams are interesting. We should learn to arrange our waking life the same way, nothing or interesting.
04:20:01 - 04:20:11
233. The Most Dangerous Point of View. What I do or do not do now is as important for everything
04:20:11 - 04:20:16
that is yet to come, as is the greatest event of the past. In this tremendous perspective of
04:20:16 - 04:20:27
effectiveness, all actions appear equally great and small. 234. A Musician's Comfort. Your life
04:20:28 - 04:20:32
does not reach men's ears. Your life is silent for them, and all the subtleties of its melody,
04:20:32 - 04:20:37
all tender resolutions about following or going ahead remain hidden from them. True,
04:20:37 - 04:20:42
you do not approach on a broad highway with regimental music, but that does not give these
04:20:42 - 04:20:47
good people any right to say that your way of life lacks music. Let those who have ears hear.
04:20:47 - 04:20:57
235. Spirit and Character. Some reach their peak as characters, but their spirit is not up to this
04:20:57 - 04:21:06
height, while with others it happens the other way around. 236. To Move the Crowd. Must not anyone
04:21:06 - 04:21:11
who wants to move the crowd be an actor who impersonates himself? Must he not first translate
04:21:11 - 04:21:16
himself into grotesque obviousness, and then present his whole person and cause in this
04:21:16 - 04:21:27
coarsened and simplified version? 237. Polite. He is so polite. Yes, he always carries a biscuit
04:21:27 - 04:21:33
for Cerberus, and is so timid that he thinks everyone is Cerberus, even you and I. That is
04:21:33 - 04:21:40
his politeness. 238. Without Envy. He is utterly without envy, but there is no merit in that,
04:21:40 - 04:21:43
for he wants to conquer a country that nobody has possessed and scarcely anyone has even seen.
04:21:43 - 04:21:54
239. Joyless. A single joyless person is enough to create constant discouragement and cloudy skies
04:21:54 - 04:21:59
for a whole household, and it is a miracle if there is not one person like that. Happiness.
04:21:59 - 04:22:04
is not nearly so contagious a disease. Why? 240.
04:22:06 - 04:22:09
At the sea. I would not build a house for myself, and I count it part of my good fortune that I do
04:22:09 - 04:22:13
not own a house. But if I had to, then I should build it as some of the Romans did, right into
04:22:13 - 04:22:19
the sea. I should not mind sharing a few secrets with this beautiful monster. 41.
04:22:23 - 04:22:28
Work and artist. This artist is ambitious, nothing more. Ultimately, his work is merely a magnifying
04:22:28 - 04:22:32
glass that he offers everybody who looks his way. 242.
04:22:34 - 04:22:42
Sum Quique. 62. However great the greed of my desire for knowledge may be, I still cannot take
04:22:42 - 04:22:47
anything out of things that did not belong to me before. What belongs to others remains behind.
04:22:48 - 04:22:53
How is it possible for a human being to be a thief or robber? 243.
04:22:54 - 04:23:02
Origin of good and bad. Improvements are invented only by those who can feel that something is not
04:23:02 - 04:23:14
good. 244. Thoughts and words. Even one's thoughts one cannot reproduce entirely in words. 245.
04:23:16 - 04:23:21
Praise by choice. An artist chooses his subjects, that is his way of praising.
04:23:21 - 04:23:34
246. Mathematics. Let us introduce the refinement and rigor of mathematics into all sciences as far
04:23:34 - 04:23:38
as this is at all possible. Not in the faith that this will lead us to know things, but in order to
04:23:38 - 04:23:43
determine our human relation to things. Mathematics is merely the means for general and ultimate
04:23:43 - 04:23:53
knowledge of man. 247. Habit. Every habit lends our hand more wit, but makes our wit less handy.
04:23:55 - 04:24:05
248. Books. What good is a book that does not even carry us beyond all books? 249.
04:24:06 - 04:24:11
The sigh of the search for knowledge. Oh, my greed! There is no selflessness in my soul,
04:24:12 - 04:24:18
but only an all-coveting self that would like to appropriate many individuals as so many additional
04:24:18 - 04:24:24
pairs of eyes and hands. A self that would like to bring back the whole past, too, and that will not
04:24:24 - 04:24:31
lose anything that it could possibly possess. Oh, my greed is a flame! Oh, that I might be reborn
04:24:31 - 04:24:36
in a hundred beings! Whoever does not know this sigh from first-hand experience does not know
04:24:36 - 04:24:45
the passion of the search for knowledge. 250. Guilt. Although the shrewdest judges of the
04:24:45 - 04:24:49
witches and even the witches themselves were convinced of the guilt of witchery,
04:24:49 - 04:24:56
this guilt nevertheless did not exist. This applies to all guilt. 251.
04:24:57 - 04:25:03
Misunderstood sufferers. Magnificent characters suffer very differently from what their admirers
04:25:03 - 04:25:09
imagine. They suffer most keenly from the ignoble and petty agitations of some evil moments,
04:25:09 - 04:25:14
briefly from their doubts about their own magnificence, not from the sacrifices and
04:25:14 - 04:25:20
martyrdoms that their task demands from them. As long as Prometheus feels pity for men and
04:25:20 - 04:25:27
sacrifices himself for them, he is happy and great. But when he becomes envious of Zeus and
04:25:27 - 04:25:37
the homage paid to him by mortals, then he suffers. 252. Better a debtor. Better a debtor
04:25:37 - 04:25:43
than pay with a coin that does not bear our image, says our sovereignty. 253.
04:25:44 - 04:25:50
Always at home. One day we reach our goal and now point with pride to the long travels we undertook
04:25:50 - 04:25:56
to reach it. In fact, we were not even aware of traveling, but we got so far because we fancied
04:25:56 - 04:26:04
at every point that we were at home. 254. Against embarrassment. If you're always profoundly
04:26:04 - 04:26:17
occupied, you're beyond all embarrassment. 255. Imitators. A. What? You want no imitators? B. I do
04:26:17 - 04:26:21
not want to have people imitate my example. I wish that everybody would fashion his own example as I
04:26:21 - 04:26:32
do. A. So? 256. Skin-coveredness. All people who have depth find happiness in being for once like
04:26:32 - 04:26:35
flying fish, playing on the peaks of waves. What they consider best in things is that they have a
04:26:35 - 04:26:45
surface, their skin, coveredness. Sit venya verbo. 257. From experience. Some do not know how rich
04:26:45 - 04:26:55
they are until they experience how rich people steal from them. 258. The denial of chance. No
04:26:55 - 04:27:04
victor believes in chance. 259. From paradise. Good and evil are the prejudices of God,
04:27:05 - 04:27:15
said the snake. 260. Multiplication table. One is always wrong, but with two, truth begins.
04:27:15 - 04:27:20
One cannot prove his case, but two are irrefutable. 261.
04:27:21 - 04:27:29
Originality. What is originality? To see something that has no name as yet, and hence cannot be
04:27:29 - 04:27:34
mentioned although it stares us all in the face. The way men usually are, it takes a name to make
04:27:34 - 04:27:40
something visible for them. Those with originality have for the most part also assigned names.
04:27:41 - 04:27:55
262. Subspecie attorney 66. A. You are moving away faster and faster from the living. Soon they will
04:27:55 - 04:28:01
strike your name from their rolls. B. That is the only way to participate in the privilege of the
04:28:01 - 04:28:14
dead. A. What privilege? B. To die no more. 263. Without vanity. When we are in love, we wish that
04:28:14 - 04:28:19
our defects might remain concealed, not from vanity but to keep the beloved from suffering.
04:28:20 - 04:28:31
Indeed, the lover would like to seem divine, and this too, not from vanity. 264. What we do.
04:28:31 - 04:28:37
What we do is never understood but always only praised or censured. 265.
04:28:40 - 04:28:46
Ultimate Skepsis. What are man's truths ultimately? Merely his irrefutable errors.
04:28:48 - 04:28:55
266. Where cruelty is needed, those who have greatness are cruel to their virtues and to
04:28:55 - 04:29:05
secondary considerations. 267. With a great goal. With a great goal, one is superior even to justice,
04:29:06 - 04:29:16
not only to one's deeds and one's judges. 268. What makes one heroic? Going out to
04:29:16 - 04:29:21
meet at the same time one's highest suffering and one's highest hope. 269.
04:29:22 - 04:29:29
In what do you believe? In this, that the weights of all things must be determined anew. 270.
04:29:31 - 04:29:38
What does your conscience say? You shall become the person you are. 271.
04:29:39 - 04:29:50
Where are your greatest dangers? In pity. 272. What do you love in others? My hopes.
04:29:52 - 04:29:53
273.
04:29:56 - 04:30:00
Whom do you call bad? Those who always want to put to shame.
04:30:02 - 04:30:05
Afinam. 274.
04:30:08 - 04:30:15
What do you consider most humane? To spare someone's shame. 275.
04:30:16 - 04:30:21
What is the seal of liberation? No longer being ashamed in front of oneself.
04:30:22 - 04:30:34
Book 4. Sanctus Januarius. With a flaming spear you crushed all its ice until my soul, roaring toward the ocean rushed of its highest hope and goal.
04:30:35 - 04:30:41
Ever healthier it swells, lovingly compelled but free. Thus it lauds your miracles. Fairest month of January.
04:30:42 - 04:30:47
Genoa. January 1882. 276.
04:30:49 - 04:30:55
For the new year. I still live. I still think. I still have to live. For I still have to think.
04:30:55 - 04:31:01
Some. Ergo cogito. Cogito. Ergo. Some. Today everybody permits himself the expression of his
04:31:01 - 04:31:07
wish and his dearest thought. Hence I too shall say what it is that I wish from myself today.
04:31:07 - 04:31:12
And what was the first thought to run across my heart this year? What thought shall be for me the
04:31:12 - 04:31:17
reason, warranty, and sweetness of my life henceforth? I want to learn more and more to
04:31:17 - 04:31:23
see as beautiful what is necessary in things. Then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful.
04:31:24 - 04:31:31
Amor fati. Let that be my love henceforth. I do not want to wage war against what is ugly.
04:31:31 - 04:31:35
I do not want to accuse. I do not even want to accuse those who accuse.
04:31:36 - 04:31:40
Looking away shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole,
04:31:41 - 04:31:48
someday I wish to be only a yes-sayer. 277. Personal Providence.
04:31:50 - 04:31:54
There is a certain high point in life. Once we have reached that, we are, for all our freedom,
04:31:54 - 04:31:57
once more in the greatest danger of spiritual unfreedom, and no matter how much we have,
04:31:57 - 04:32:03
faced up to the beautiful chaos of existence, and denied it all providential reason and goodness,
04:32:03 - 04:32:09
we still have to pass our hardest test. For it is only now that the idea of a personal
04:32:09 - 04:32:15
providence confronts us with the most penetrating force and the best advocate. The evidence of our
04:32:15 - 04:32:21
eyes speaks for it, now that we can see how palpably always everything that happens to us
04:32:21 - 04:32:28
turns out for the best. Every day and every hour, life seems to have no other wish than to prove
04:32:28 - 04:32:35
this proposition again and again. Whatever it is, bad weather or good, the loss of a friend,
04:32:35 - 04:32:41
sickness, slander, the failure of some letter to arrive, the spraining of an ankle, a glance into
04:32:41 - 04:32:48
a shop, a counterargument, the opening of a book, a dream, a fraud, either immediately or very soon
04:32:48 - 04:32:54
after it proves to be something that must not be missing, it has a profound significance and
04:32:54 - 04:33:00
use precisely for us. Is there any more dangerous seduction that might tempt one to renounce one's
04:33:00 - 04:33:06
faith in the gods of Epicurus, who have no care and are unknown, and to believe instead in some
04:33:06 - 04:33:12
petty deity who is full of care and personally knows every little hair on our head and finds
04:33:12 - 04:33:18
nothing nauseous in the most miserable small service? Well, I think that in spite of all this,
04:33:18 - 04:33:24
we should leave the gods in peace, as well as the genii who are ready to serve us, and rest
04:33:24 - 04:33:29
content with the supposition that our own practical and theoretical skill in interpreting and arranging
04:33:29 - 04:33:36
events has now reached its high point. Nor should we conceive too high an opinion of this dexterity
04:33:36 - 04:33:42
of our wisdom, when at times we are excessively surprised by the wonderful harmony created by the
04:33:42 - 04:33:47
playing of our instrument, a harmony that sounds too good for us to dare to give the credit to
04:33:47 - 04:33:54
ourselves. Indeed, now and then someone plays with us. Good old chance. Now and then chance guides
04:33:54 - 04:33:59
our hand, and the wisest providence could not think up a more beautiful music than that which
04:33:59 - 04:34:07
our foolish hand produces then. 278. The thought of death, living in the midst of this jumble of
04:34:07 - 04:34:11
little lanes, needs, and voices, gives me a melancholy happiness. How much enjoyment, impatience, and desire,
04:34:11 - 04:34:16
how much thirsty life and drunkenness of life comes to light every moment, and yet silence will
04:34:16 - 04:34:22
soon descend on all these noisy, living, life-thirsty people. How his shadow stands even now behind
04:34:22 - 04:34:28
everyone, as his dark fellow-traveler. It is always like the last moment before the departure of an
04:34:28 - 04:34:34
emigrant's ship. People have more to say to each other than ever. The hour is late, and the ocean
04:34:34 - 04:34:39
and its desolate silence are waiting impatiently behind all of this noise, so covetous and certain
04:34:39 - 04:34:45
of their prey. And all and every one of them supposed that the heretofore was little or nothing
04:34:45 - 04:34:51
while the near future is everything. And that is the reason for all of this haste, this clamor,
04:34:51 - 04:34:56
this outshouting and overreaching each other. Everyone wants to be the first in this future,
04:34:57 - 04:35:02
and yet death and deathly silence alone are certain and common to all in this future.
04:35:03 - 04:35:08
How strange it is that this sole certainty and common element makes almost no impression on
04:35:08 - 04:35:14
people, and that nothing is further from their minds than the feeling that they form a brotherhood
04:35:14 - 04:35:20
of death. It makes me happy that men do not want at all to think the thought of death. I should
04:35:20 - 04:35:24
like very much to do something that would make the thought of life even a hundred times more
04:35:24 - 04:35:35
appealing to them. 279. Star Friendship. We were friends and have become estranged,
04:35:35 - 04:35:40
but this was right, and we do not want to conceal and obscure it from ourselves as if we had reason
04:35:40 - 04:35:47
to feel ashamed. We are two ships, each of which has its goal and course. Our paths may cross,
04:35:47 - 04:35:53
and we may celebrate a feast together, as we did. And then the good ships rested so quietly in one
04:35:53 - 04:35:59
harbor and one sunshine that it may have looked as if they had reached their goal, and as if they
04:35:59 - 04:36:05
had one goal. But then the almighty force of our tasks drove us apart again into different seas
04:36:05 - 04:36:10
and sunny zones, and perhaps we shall never see each other again. Perhaps we shall meet again,
04:36:10 - 04:36:16
but fail to recognize each other. Our exposure to different seas and suns has changed us.
04:36:17 - 04:36:22
That we have to become estranged is the law above us. By the same token, we should also become more
04:36:22 - 04:36:29
venerable for each other, and the memory of our former friendship more sacred. There is probably
04:36:29 - 04:36:34
a tremendous but invisible stellar orbit in which our very different ways and goals may be included
04:36:34 - 04:36:41
as small parts of this path. Let us rise up to this thought. But our life is too short, and our
04:36:41 - 04:36:46
power of vision too small for us to be more than friends in the sense of this sublime possibility.
04:36:47 - 04:36:52
Let us then believe in our star friendship, even if we should be compelled to be earth enemies.
04:36:53 - 04:37:01
280. Architecture for the Search for Knowledge. One day, and probably soon, we need some
04:37:01 - 04:37:07
recognition of what above all is lacking in our big cities. Quiet and wide, expansive places for
04:37:07 - 04:37:13
reflection. Places with long, high-ceilinged cloisters for bad or all-too-sunny weather,
04:37:13 - 04:37:19
where no shouting or noise of carriages can reach, and where good manners would prohibit even priests
04:37:19 - 04:37:24
from praying aloud. Buildings and sites that would altogether give expression to the sublimity of
04:37:24 - 04:37:30
thoughtfulness and of stepping aside. The time has passed when the church possessed a monopoly
04:37:30 - 04:37:36
on reflection, when the vita contemplativa always had to be, first of all, a vita religiosa.
04:37:37 - 04:37:41
And everything built by the church gives expression to that idea. I do not see how
04:37:41 - 04:37:46
we could remain content with such buildings even if they were stripped of their churchly purposes.
04:37:47 - 04:37:52
The language spoken by these buildings is far too rhetorical and unfree, reminding us that
04:37:52 - 04:37:57
they are houses of God and ostentatious monuments of some supramundane intercourse.
04:37:58 - 04:38:04
We who are godless could not think our thoughts in such surroundings. We wish to see ourselves
04:38:04 - 04:38:09
translated into stone and plants. We want to take walks in ourselves when we stroll around
04:38:09 - 04:38:16
these buildings and gardens. 281. Knowing how to end.
04:38:17 - 04:38:22
Masters of the first rank are revealed by the fact that in great as well as small matters,
04:38:22 - 04:38:27
they know how to end perfectly, whether it is a matter of ending a melody or a thought,
04:38:27 - 04:38:33
or the fifth act of a tragedy or of an action of state. The best of the second rank always
04:38:33 - 04:38:39
become restless as the end approaches and do not manage to slope into the sea in such proud and
04:38:39 - 04:38:46
calm harmony as, for example, the mountains at Portofino, where the Bay of Genoa ends its melody.
04:38:47 - 04:38:50
282. Gate.
04:38:51 - 04:38:56
By certain manners of the spirit even great spirits betray that they come from the mob
04:38:56 - 04:39:01
or semi-mob. It is above all the gate and stride of their thoughts that betrays them.
04:39:01 - 04:39:09
They cannot walk. Thus Napoleon, too, was unable to his profound chagrin to walk like a prince
04:39:09 - 04:39:14
legitimately on occasions when that is really required, such as great coronation processions.
04:39:15 - 04:39:20
Even then he was always only the leader of a column, proud and hasty at the same time,
04:39:20 - 04:39:23
and very conscious of this. There is something laughable about the sight of authors who enjoy
04:39:23 - 04:39:26
the rustling folds of long and involved sentences. They are trying to cover up their feet.
04:39:27 - 04:39:32
283. Preparatory Human Beings.
04:39:33 - 04:39:39
I welcome all signs that a more virile, warlike age is about to begin, which will restore honor
04:39:39 - 04:39:46
to courage above all. For this age shall prepare the way for one yet higher, and it shall gather
04:39:46 - 04:39:52
the strength that this higher age will require some day, the age that will carry heroism into
04:39:52 - 04:39:57
the search for knowledge, and that will wage wars for the sake of ideas and their consequences.
04:39:58 - 04:40:04
To this end, we now need many preparatory courageous human beings who cannot very well
04:40:04 - 04:40:09
leap out of nothing, any more than out of the sand and slime of present-day civilization
04:40:09 - 04:40:15
and metropolitanism. Human beings who know how to be silent, lonely, resolute, and content and
04:40:15 - 04:40:21
constant in invisible activities. Human beings who are bent on seeking in all things for what
04:40:21 - 04:40:27
in them must be overcome. Human beings distinguished as much by cheerfulness, patience,
04:40:27 - 04:40:33
unpretentiousness, and contempt for all great vanities as by magnanimity in victory and
04:40:33 - 04:40:39
forbearance regarding the small vanities of the vanquished. Human beings whose judgment concerning
04:40:39 - 04:40:45
all victors and the share of chance in every victory and fame is sharp and free.
04:40:46 - 04:40:52
Human beings with their own festivals, their own working days, and their own periods of mourning,
04:40:52 - 04:40:56
accustomed to command with assurance but instantly ready to obey when that is called for,
04:40:57 - 04:41:04
equally proud, equally serving their own cause in both cases. More endangered human beings,
04:41:04 - 04:41:11
more fruitful human beings, happier beings. For believe me, the secret for harvesting from
04:41:11 - 04:41:17
existence, the greatest fruitfulness, and the greatest enjoyment is to live dangerously.
04:41:17 - 04:41:24
Build your cities on the slopes of Vesuvius. Send your ships into uncharted seas. Live at war
04:41:24 - 04:41:29
with your peers and yourselves. Be robbers and conquerors as long as you cannot be rulers and
04:41:29 - 04:41:35
possessors, you seekers of knowledge. Soon the age will be past when you could be content to
04:41:35 - 04:41:40
live hidden in forests like shy deer. At long last the search for knowledge will reach out for its
04:41:40 - 04:41:49
due. It will want to rule and possess, and you with it. 284. Faith in Oneself.
04:41:52 - 04:41:58
Few people have faith in themselves. Of these few, some are endowed with it, as with a useful
04:41:58 - 04:42:03
blindness or a partial eclipse of their spirit. What would they behold if they could see to the
04:42:03 - 04:42:09
bottom of themselves, while the rest have to acquire it? Everything good, fine, or great,
04:42:09 - 04:42:14
they do as first of all an argument against the skeptic inside them. They have to convince or
04:42:14 - 04:42:20
persuade him, and that almost requires genius. These are the great self-dissatisfied people.
04:42:21 - 04:42:31
285. Excelsior. You will never pray again, never adore again, never again rest in endless trust.
04:42:32 - 04:42:37
You do not permit yourself to stop before any ultimate wisdom, ultimate goodness, ultimate power,
04:42:37 - 04:42:42
while unharnessing your thoughts. You have no perpetual guardian and friend for your seven
04:42:42 - 04:42:48
solitudes. You live without a view of mountains with snow on their peaks and fire in their hearts.
04:42:48 - 04:42:54
There is no avenger for you anymore, nor any final improver. There is no longer any reason
04:42:54 - 04:43:01
in what happens, no love in what will happen to you. No resting place is open any longer to your
04:43:01 - 04:43:08
heart, where it only needs to find and no longer to seek. You resist any ultimate peace. You will
04:43:08 - 04:43:14
the eternal recurrence of war and peace, man of renunciation. All this you wish to renounce?
04:43:15 - 04:43:19
Who will give you the strength for that? Nobody yet has had this strength.
04:43:20 - 04:43:26
There is a lake that one day ceased to permit itself to flow off. It formed a dam where it
04:43:26 - 04:43:33
had hitherto flown off, and ever since this lake is rising higher and higher. Perhaps this very
04:43:33 - 04:43:39
renunciation will also lend us the strength needed to bear this renunciation. Perhaps man will rise
04:43:39 - 04:43:43
ever higher as soon as he ceases to flow out into a god.
04:43:45 - 04:43:45
Trump 86
04:43:47 - 04:43:48
Interruption
04:43:49 - 04:43:49
Hear our hope
04:43:49 - 04:43:54
ships, but what will you hear and see of them if you have not experienced splendor, ardor,
04:43:54 - 04:44:01
and dawns in your own souls? I can only remind you, more I cannot do. To move stones? To
04:44:01 - 04:44:07
turn animals into men? Is that what you want from me? Oh, if you are still stones and animals,
04:44:07 - 04:44:13
then better look for your Orpheus." 287.
04:44:13 - 04:44:14
Delight in Blindness
04:44:14 - 04:44:21
"'My thoughts,' said the wanderer to his shadow, "'should show me where I stand, but they should
04:44:21 - 04:44:27
not betray to me where I am going. I love my ignorance of the future, and do not wish
04:44:27 - 04:44:31
to perish of impatience and of tasting promised things ahead of time.'"
04:44:31 - 04:44:38
288. Elevated Moods
04:44:38 - 04:44:42
It seems to me that most people simply do not believe in elevated moods unless these
04:44:42 - 04:44:47
last for moments only or at most a quarter of an hour, except for those few who know
04:44:47 - 04:44:52
at first hand the longer duration of elevated feelings. But to be a human being with one
04:44:52 - 04:44:58
elevated feeling, to be a single great mood incarnate, that has hitherto been a mere dream
04:44:58 - 04:45:06
and a delightful possibility, as yet, history does not offer us any certain examples. Nevertheless,
04:45:06 - 04:45:11
history might one day give birth to such people too, once a great many favorable preconditions
04:45:11 - 04:45:16
have been created and determined that even the dice throws of the luckiest chance could
04:45:16 - 04:45:21
not bring together today. What has so far entered our souls only now and then as an
04:45:21 - 04:45:27
exception that made us shudder might perhaps be the usual state for these future souls,
04:45:27 - 04:45:33
a perpetual movement between high and low, the feeling of high and low, a continual ascent
04:45:33 - 04:45:36
as on stairs and at the same time a sense of resting on clouds.
04:45:36 - 04:45:42
289 Embark
04:45:42 - 04:45:48
Consider how every individual is affected by an overall philosophical justification of his way
04:45:48 - 04:45:54
of living and thinking. He experiences it as a sun that shines especially for him and bestows
04:45:54 - 04:45:59
warmth, blessings, and fertility on him. It makes him independent of praise and blame,
04:45:59 - 04:46:05
self-sufficient, rich, liberal with happiness and goodwill. Incessantly it refashions evil
04:46:05 - 04:46:11
into good, leads all energies to bloom and ripen, and does not permit the petty weeds
04:46:11 - 04:46:17
of grief and chagrin to come up at all. In the end one exclaims, How I wish that many
04:46:17 - 04:46:22
such new suns were yet to be created! Those who are evil or unhappy, and the exceptional
04:46:22 - 04:46:28
human being, all these should also have their philosophy, their good right, their sunshine.
04:46:28 - 04:46:35
What is needful is not pity for them. We must learn to abandon this arrogant fancy,
04:46:35 - 04:46:41
however long humanity has hitherto spent learning and practicing it. What these people need is not
04:46:41 - 04:46:47
confession, conjuring of souls, and forgiveness of sins. What is needful is a new justice,
04:46:47 - 04:46:54
and a new watchword, and new philosophers. The moral earth, too, is round. The moral
04:46:54 - 04:46:59
earth, too, has its antipodes. The antipodes, too, have the right to exist. There is yet
04:46:59 - 04:47:04
another world to be discovered, and more than one. Embark, philosophers!
04:47:04 - 04:47:06
II.90
04:47:06 - 04:47:14
One thing is needful. To give style to one's character, a great and rare art,
04:47:14 - 04:47:19
it is practiced by those who survey all the strengths and weaknesses of their nature,
04:47:19 - 04:47:25
and then fit them into an artistic plan until every one of them appears as art and reason,
04:47:25 - 04:47:31
and even weaknesses delight the eye. Here a large mass of second nature has been added,
04:47:31 - 04:47:37
there a piece of original nature has been removed, both times through long practice and daily work
04:47:37 - 04:47:44
at it. Here the ugly that could not be removed is concealed, there it has been reinterpreted and
04:47:44 - 04:47:50
sublime. Much that is vague and resisted shaping has been saved and exploited for distant views.
04:47:50 - 04:47:56
It is meant to beckon toward the far and immeasurable. In the end, when the work is
04:47:56 - 04:48:02
finished, it becomes evident how the constraint of a single taste to govern it and form it
04:48:02 - 04:48:07
everything large and small, whether this taste was good or bad is less important than one might
04:48:07 - 04:48:13
suppose, if only it was a single taste. It will be the strong and domineering natures that enjoy
04:48:13 - 04:48:19
their finest gaiety in such constraint and perfection under a law of their own. The passion
04:48:19 - 04:48:25
of their tremendous will relents in the face of all stylized nature, of all conquered and serving
04:48:25 - 04:48:31
nature. Even when they have to build palaces and design gardens, they demur at giving nature
04:48:31 - 04:48:38
freedom. Conversely, it is the weak characters without power over themselves that hate the
04:48:38 - 04:48:43
constraint of style. They feel that if this bitter and evil constraint were imposed upon
04:48:43 - 04:48:50
them, they would be demeaned. They become slaves as soon as they serve. They hate to serve. Such
04:48:50 - 04:48:55
spirits, and they may be of the first rank, are always out to shape and interpret their
04:48:55 - 04:49:02
environment as free nature, wild, arbitrary, fantastic, disorderly and surprising. And they
04:49:02 - 04:49:07
are well advised because it is only in this way that they can give pleasure to themselves. For
04:49:07 - 04:49:13
one thing is needful, that a human being should attain satisfaction with himself, whether it be
04:49:13 - 04:49:19
by means of this or that poetry and art, only then is a human being at all tolerable to behold.
04:49:19 - 04:49:26
Whoever is dissatisfied with himself is continually ready for revenge, and we others will be his
04:49:26 - 04:49:32
victims, if only by having to endure his ugly sight. For the sight of what is ugly makes one
04:49:32 - 04:49:43
bad and gloomy. 291. Genoa. For a long while now, I have been looking at this city, at its villas
04:49:43 - 04:49:49
and pleasure gardens, and the far-flung periphery of its inhabited heights and slopes. In the end,
04:49:49 - 04:49:55
I must say, I see faces that belong to past generations. This region is studded with the
04:49:55 - 04:50:01
images of bold and autocratic human beings. They have lived and wished to live on. That is what
04:50:01 - 04:50:07
they are telling me with their houses, built and adorned to last for centuries and not for
04:50:07 - 04:50:13
a fleeting hour. They were well disposed toward life, however ill-disposed they often may have
04:50:13 - 04:50:19
been toward themselves. I keep seeing the builders, their eyes resting on everything near and far that
04:50:19 - 04:50:25
they have built, and also on the city, the sea and the contours of the mountains, and there is
04:50:25 - 04:50:31
violence and conquest in their eyes. All this they want to fit into their plan and ultimately make
04:50:31 - 04:50:36
their possession by making it part of their plan. This whole region is overgrown with this
04:50:36 - 04:50:42
magnificent, insatiable selfishness of the lust for possessions and spoils. And even as these
04:50:42 - 04:50:48
people refused to recognize any boundaries in distant lands and, thirsting for what was new,
04:50:48 - 04:50:54
placed a new world beside the old one, each rebelled against each at home, too, and found
04:50:54 - 04:50:59
a way to express his superiority and to lay between himself and his neighbor his personal
04:50:59 - 04:51:05
infinity. Each once more conquered his homeland for himself by overwhelming it with his architectural
04:51:05 - 04:51:12
ideas and refashioning it into a house that was a feast for his eyes. In the North one is impressed
04:51:12 - 04:51:18
by the law and the general delight in lawfulness and obedience as one contemplates the way cities
04:51:18 - 04:51:24
are built. One is led to guess at the ways in which, deep down, people posited themselves as
04:51:24 - 04:51:30
equal and subordinated themselves. That must have been what was dominant in the souls of all
04:51:30 - 04:51:36
builders. But what you find here upon turning any corner is a human being apart who knows the sea,
04:51:36 - 04:51:43
adventure, and the Orient. A human being who abhors the law and the neighbor as a kind of
04:51:43 - 04:51:49
boredom and who measures everything old and established with envious eyes. With the marvelous
04:51:49 - 04:51:55
cunning of his imagination, he would like to establish all of this anew, at least in thought,
04:51:55 - 04:52:00
and put his hand to it and his meaning into it, if only for the moments of a sunny afternoon when
04:52:00 - 04:52:07
his insatiable and melancholy soul does feel sated for once, and only what is his and nothing alien
04:52:07 - 04:52:17
may appear to his eyes. 292. To those who preach morals, I do not wish to promote any morality,
04:52:17 - 04:52:23
but to those who do, I give this advice. If you wish to deprive the best things and states
04:52:23 - 04:52:28
of all honor and worth, then go on talking about them as you have been doing. Place them at the
04:52:28 - 04:52:34
head of your morality and talk from morning to night of the happiness of virtue, the composure
04:52:34 - 04:52:41
of the soul, of justice and imminent retribution. The way you are going about it, all these good
04:52:41 - 04:52:45
things will eventually have popularity and the clamor of the streets on their side,
04:52:46 - 04:52:51
but at the same time all the gold that was on them will have been worn off by so much handling,
04:52:51 - 04:52:57
and all the gold inside will have turned to lead. Truly, you are masters of alchemy in reverse,
04:52:58 - 04:53:03
the devaluation of what is most valuable. Why don't you make the experiment of trying another
04:53:03 - 04:53:08
prescription to keep from attaining the opposite of your goal, as you have done hitherto?
04:53:09 - 04:53:14
Deny these good things, withdraw the mob's acclaim from them as well as their easy currency,
04:53:15 - 04:53:21
make them once again concealed secrets of solitary souls, say that morality is something forbidden.
04:53:22 - 04:53:26
That way you might win over for these things the kind of people who alone matter,
04:53:26 - 04:53:32
I mean those who are heroic, but to that end there has to be a quality that inspires fear
04:53:32 - 04:53:39
and not, as hitherto, nausea. Hasn't the time come to say of morality, what Master Eckhart said,
04:53:40 - 04:53:49
I ask God to rid me of God? To 93. Our Heir. We know very well how science strikes those
04:53:49 - 04:53:55
who merely glance at it in passing, as if they were walking by, as women do, and unfortunately
04:53:55 - 04:54:01
also many artists, the severity of its service, its inexorability in small as in great matters,
04:54:01 - 04:54:07
and the speed of weighing and judging matters and passing judgment makes them feel dizzy and afraid.
04:54:07 - 04:54:12
Above all they are terrified to see how the most difficult is demanded and the best is done without
04:54:12 - 04:54:20
praise and decorations. Indeed, what one hears is, as among soldiers, mostly reproaches and
04:54:20 - 04:54:27
harsh rebukes, for doing things well is considered the rule and failure is the exception, but the
04:54:27 - 04:54:34
rule always tends to keep quiet. This severity of science has the same effect as the forms and
04:54:34 - 04:54:40
good manners of the best society. It is frightening for the uninitiated, but those
04:54:40 - 04:54:44
who are used to it would never wish to live anywhere else than in this bright, transparent,
04:54:44 - 04:54:52
vigorous, electrified air, in this virile air. Anywhere else things are not clean and airy enough
04:54:52 - 04:54:58
for them. They suspect that elsewhere their best art would not really profit others nor give real
04:54:58 - 04:55:03
delight to themselves, that among misunderstandings half of their lives would slip through their
04:55:03 - 04:55:09
fingers, that they would be required to exercise a great deal of caution, conceal things, be
04:55:09 - 04:55:15
inhibited, so many ways of losing a lot of strength for no good reason. But in this severe and clear
04:55:15 - 04:55:22
element they have their full strength. Here they can fly. Why then go down into those muddy waters
04:55:22 - 04:55:28
where one has to swim and wade and get one's wings dirty? No, it is too hard for us to live there.
04:55:29 - 04:55:35
Is it our fault that we were born for the air, clean air, we rivals of the beams of light,
04:55:35 - 04:55:41
and that we wish we could ride on ethereal dust specks like these beams, not away from the sun,
04:55:41 - 04:55:48
but toward the sun? That, however, we cannot do. Let us therefore do what alone we can do.
04:55:49 - 04:55:54
Bring light to the earth, be the light of the earth, and to that end we have our wings and
04:55:54 - 04:56:01
our speed and severity. For this are we virile and even terrible like fire. Let those be terrified
04:56:01 - 04:56:11
by us who do not know how to gain warmth and light from us. 294. Against the slanderers of nature.
04:56:12 - 04:56:18
I find those people disagreeable in whom every natural inclination immediately becomes a sickness,
04:56:18 - 04:56:24
something that disfigures them or is downright infamous. It is they that have seduced use to
04:56:24 - 04:56:31
hold that man's inclinations and instincts are evil. They are the cause of our great injustice
04:56:31 - 04:56:37
against our nature, against all nature. There are enough people who might well entrust themselves
04:56:37 - 04:56:43
to their instincts with grace and without care, but they do not, from fear of this imagined evil
04:56:43 - 04:56:49
character of nature. That is why we find so little nobility among men, for it will always
04:56:49 - 04:56:56
be the mark of nobility that one feels no fear of one's self, expects nothing infamous of one's self,
04:56:56 - 04:57:02
flies without scruple where we feel like flying, we free-born birds. Wherever we may come there
04:57:02 - 04:57:13
will always be freedom and sunlight around us. 295. Brief habits. I love brief habits
04:57:13 - 04:57:17
and consider them an inestimable means for getting to know many things and states
04:57:17 - 04:57:22
down to the bottom of their sweetness and bitternesses. My nature is designed entirely
04:57:22 - 04:57:28
for brief habits, even in the needs of my physical health and altogether as far as I can see it all,
04:57:28 - 04:57:34
from the lowest to the highest. I always believe that here is something that will give me lasting
04:57:34 - 04:57:40
satisfaction. Brief habits, too, have this faith of passion, this faith in eternity,
04:57:40 - 04:57:46
and that I am to be envied for having found and recognized it, and now it nourishes me at noon
04:57:46 - 04:57:51
and in the evening and spreads a deep contentment all around itself and deep into me so that I
04:57:51 - 04:57:59
desire nothing else, without having any need for comparisons, contempt or hatred. But one day its
04:57:59 - 04:58:05
time is up. The good thing parts from me, not as something that has come to nauseate me but
04:58:05 - 04:58:10
peacefully and sated with me as I am with it, as if we had reason to be grateful to each other
04:58:10 - 04:58:15
as we shook hands to say farewell. Even then something new is waiting at the door,
04:58:15 - 04:58:23
along with my faith, this indestructible fool and sage, that this new discovery will be just right
04:58:23 - 04:58:29
and that this will be the last time. That is what happens to me with dishes, ideas, human beings,
04:58:29 - 04:58:34
cities, poems, music, doctrines, ways of arranging the day and lifestyles.
04:58:35 - 04:58:43
Enduring habits. I hate. I feel as if a tyrant had come near me and as if the air I breathe
04:58:43 - 04:58:48
had thickened when events take such a turn that it appears that they will inevitably give rise
04:58:48 - 04:58:54
to enduring habits. For example, owing to an official position, constant association with the
04:58:54 - 04:59:01
same people, a permanent domicile, or unique good health. Yes, at the very bottom of my soul,
04:59:01 - 04:59:06
I feel grateful to all my misery and bouts of sickness, and everything about me that is
04:59:06 - 04:59:11
imperfect, because this sort of thing leaves me with a hundred backdoors through which I can escape
04:59:11 - 04:59:18
from enduring habits. Most intolerable, to be sure, and the terrible par excellence would be for me a
04:59:18 - 04:59:24
life entirely devoid of habits, a life that would demand perpetual improvisation. That would be my
04:59:24 - 04:59:35
exile and my Siberia. 296. A firm reputation. A firm reputation used to be extremely useful,
04:59:35 - 04:59:39
and wherever society is still dominated by the herd instinct, it is still most expedient for
04:59:39 - 04:59:45
everyone to pretend that his character and occupation are unchangeable, even if at bottom
04:59:45 - 04:59:52
they are not. One can depend on him, he remains the same. In all extremities of society, this is
04:59:52 - 04:59:58
the sort of praise that means the most. Society is pleased to feel that the virtue of this person,
04:59:58 - 05:00:03
the ambition of that one, and the thoughtfulness and passion of the third, provide it with a
05:00:03 - 05:00:09
dependable instrument that is always at hand. Society honors this instrumental nature,
05:00:09 - 05:00:16
this way of remaining faithful to oneself, this unchangeability of views, aspirations,
05:00:16 - 05:00:22
and even faults and lavishes its highest honors upon it. Such esteem, which flourishes and has
05:00:22 - 05:00:28
flourished everywhere alongside the morality of Morse, breeds character and brings all change,
05:00:28 - 05:00:35
all relearning, all self-transformation, into ill repute. However great the advantages of this way
05:00:35 - 05:00:40
of thinking may be elsewhere, for the search after knowledge, no general judgment could be
05:00:40 - 05:00:46
more harmful, for precisely the goodwill of those who seek knowledge to declare themselves
05:00:46 - 05:00:51
at any time dauntlessly against their previous opinions, and to mistrust everything that wishes
05:00:51 - 05:00:58
to become firm in us is thus condemned and brought into ill repute. Being at odds with a firm
05:00:58 - 05:01:03
reputation, the attitude of those who seek knowledge is considered dishonorable, while the
05:01:03 - 05:01:10
petrification of opinions is accorded a monopoly on honor. Under the spell of such notions, we have
05:01:10 - 05:01:17
to live to this day. How hard it is to live when one feels the opposition of many millennia all
05:01:17 - 05:01:22
around! It is probable that the search after knowledge was afflicted for many millennia,
05:01:22 - 05:01:27
with a bad conscience, and that the history of the greatest spirits must have contained a good deal
05:01:27 - 05:01:37
of self-contempt and secret misery. 297. The Ability to Contradict. Everybody knows nowadays
05:01:37 - 05:01:42
that the ability to accept criticism and contradiction is a sign of high culture. Some
05:01:42 - 05:01:47
people actually realize that higher human beings desire and provoke contradiction in order to
05:01:47 - 05:01:53
receive some hint about their own injustices, of which they are as yet unaware. But the ability
05:01:53 - 05:01:59
to contradict, the attainment of a good conscience when one feels hostile to what is accustomed,
05:01:59 - 05:02:06
traditional, and hallowed, that is still more excellent and constitutes what is really great,
05:02:06 - 05:02:12
new, and amazing in our culture. This is the step of steps of the liberated spirit. Who knows that?
05:02:13 - 05:02:22
298. Sigh. I caught this insight on the way and quickly seized the rather poor words that were
05:02:22 - 05:02:29
closest to hand to pin it down lest it fly away again. And now it has died of these arid words and
05:02:29 - 05:02:33
shakes and flaps in them, and I hardly know anymore when I look at it how I could ever
05:02:33 - 05:02:43
have felt so happy when I caught this bird. 299. What One Should Learn From Artists.
05:02:43 - 05:02:48
How can we make things beautiful, attractive, and desirable for us when they are not?
05:02:48 - 05:02:54
And I rather think that in themselves they never are. Here we could learn something from physicians
05:02:54 - 05:02:59
when, for example, they dilute what is bitter or add wine and sugar to a mixture,
05:03:00 - 05:03:04
but even more from artists who are really continually trying to bring off such inventions
05:03:04 - 05:03:10
and feats. Moving away from things until there is a good deal that one no longer sees, and there is
05:03:10 - 05:03:16
much that our eye has to add, if we are still to see them at all, or seeing things around a corner
05:03:16 - 05:03:22
and as cut out and framed, or to place them so that they partially conceal each other and grant
05:03:22 - 05:03:28
us only glimpses of architectural perspectives, or looking at them through tinted glass or in
05:03:28 - 05:03:35
the light of the sunset, or giving them a surface and skin that is not fully transparent, all this
05:03:35 - 05:03:40
we should learn from artists while being wiser than they are in other matters. For with them,
05:03:40 - 05:03:45
this subtle power usually comes to an end where art ends and life begins.
05:03:46 - 05:03:51
But we want to be the poets of our life, first of all in the smallest, most everyday matters.
05:03:52 - 05:03:56
300. Preludes of Science
05:03:58 - 05:04:03
Do you really believe that the sciences would ever have originated and grown if the way had
05:04:03 - 05:04:10
not been prepared by magicians, alchemists, astrologers, and witches whose promises and
05:04:10 - 05:04:15
pretensions first had to create a thirst, a hunger, a taste for hidden and forbidden powers?
05:04:16 - 05:04:22
Indeed, infinitely more had to be promised than could ever be fulfilled in order that anything at
05:04:22 - 05:04:28
all might be fulfilled in the realm of knowledge. Even as these preludes and preliminary exercises
05:04:28 - 05:04:33
of sciences were not by any means practiced and experienced as such, the whole of religion might
05:04:33 - 05:04:38
yet appear as a prelude and exercise to some distant age. Perhaps religion could have been
05:04:38 - 05:04:43
the strange means to make it possible for a few single individuals to enjoy the whole
05:04:43 - 05:04:50
self-sufficiency of a god and his whole power of self-redemption. Indeed, one might ask,
05:04:50 - 05:04:55
would man ever have learned without the benefit of such a religious training and prehistory
05:04:55 - 05:05:01
to experience a hunger and thirst for himself and to find satisfaction and fullness in himself?
05:05:02 - 05:05:08
Did Prometheus have to fancy first that he had stolen the light and then pay for that? Before
05:05:08 - 05:05:13
he finally discovered that he had created the light by coveting the light, and that not only
05:05:13 - 05:05:20
man but also the god was the work of his own hands and had been mere clay in his hands? All
05:05:20 - 05:05:25
mere images of the Maker, no less than the fancy, the theft, the Caucasus, the vulture,
05:05:26 - 05:05:29
and the whole tragic Promethea of all seekers after knowledge?
05:05:30 - 05:05:39
301. The Fancy of the Contemplatives. What distinguishes the higher human beings from the
05:05:39 - 05:05:39
05:05:39 - 05:05:46
lower, is that the former see and hear immeasurably more and see and hear thoughtfully, and precisely
05:05:46 - 05:05:52
this distinguishes human beings from animals, and the higher animals from the lower.
05:05:52 - 05:05:57
For anyone who grows up into the heights of humanity, the world becomes ever fuller.
05:05:57 - 05:06:01
Ever more fishhooks are cast in his direction to capture his interest.
05:06:01 - 05:06:05
The number of things that stimulate him grows constantly, as does the number of different
05:06:05 - 05:06:08
kinds of pleasure and displeasure.
05:06:08 - 05:06:13
The higher human being always becomes at the same time happier and unhappier.
05:06:13 - 05:06:15
But he can never shake off a delusion.
05:06:15 - 05:06:21
He fancies that he is a spectator and listener, who has been placed before the great visual
05:06:21 - 05:06:23
and acoustic spectacle that is life.
05:06:23 - 05:06:28
He calls his own nature contemplative, and overlooks that he himself is really the poet
05:06:28 - 05:06:31
who keeps creating this life.
05:06:31 - 05:06:36
Of course, he is different from the actor of this drama, the so-called active type.
05:06:36 - 05:06:41
But he is even less like a mere spectator and festive guest in front of the stage.
05:06:41 - 05:06:48
As a poet, he certainly has vis contemplativa and the ability to look back upon his work,
05:06:48 - 05:06:54
but at the same time also and above all vis creativa, which the active human being lacks,
05:06:54 - 05:06:58
whatever visual appearances and the faith of all the world may say.
05:06:58 - 05:07:03
We who think and feel at the same time are those who really continually fashion something
05:07:03 - 05:07:05
that had not been there before.
05:07:05 - 05:07:12
The whole eternally growing world of valuations, colors, accents, perspectives, scales, affirmations,
05:07:12 - 05:07:14
and negations.
05:07:14 - 05:07:19
This poem that we have invented is continually studied by the so-called practical human beings,
05:07:19 - 05:07:25
our actors, who learn their roles and translate everything into flesh and actuality, into
05:07:25 - 05:07:27
the everyday.
05:07:27 - 05:07:33
Whatever has value in our world now does not have value in itself according to its nature.
05:07:33 - 05:07:38
Nature is always valueless, but has been given value at some time as a present, and it was
05:07:38 - 05:07:41
we who gave and bestowed it.
05:07:41 - 05:07:45
Only we have created the world that concerns man.
05:07:45 - 05:07:50
But precisely this knowledge we lack, and when we occasionally catch it for a fleeting
05:07:50 - 05:07:53
moment, we always forget it again immediately.
05:07:53 - 05:08:00
We fail to recognize our best power and underestimate ourselves, the contemplatives, just a little.
05:08:00 - 05:08:05
We are neither as proud nor as happy as we might be.
05:08:05 - 05:08:10
302 The Danger of the Happiest
05:08:10 - 05:08:15
To have refined senses, including the sense of taste, to be accustomed to the most exquisite
05:08:15 - 05:08:21
things of the spirit as if they were simply the right and most convenient nourishment,
05:08:21 - 05:08:28
to enjoy a strong, bold, audacious soul, to go through life with a calm eye and firm step,
05:08:28 - 05:08:34
always prepared to risk all, festively, impelled by the longing for undiscovered worlds and
05:08:34 - 05:08:40
seas, people and gods, to hearken to all cheerful music as if it were a sign that bold men,
05:08:40 - 05:08:46
soldiers, seafarers, were probably seeking their brief rest and pleasure there, and in
05:08:46 - 05:08:51
the most profound enjoyment of the moment, to be overcome by tears and the whole crimson
05:08:51 - 05:08:57
melancholy of the happy, who would not wish that all this might be his possession, his
05:08:57 - 05:08:58
state.
05:08:58 - 05:09:04
This was the happiness of Homer, the state of him that gave the Greeks their gods, no,
05:09:04 - 05:09:06
who invented his own gods for himself.
05:09:06 - 05:09:08
But we should not overlook this.
05:09:08 - 05:09:13
With this Homeric happiness in one's soul, one is also more capable of suffering than
05:09:13 - 05:09:15
any other creature under the sun.
05:09:15 - 05:09:19
This is the only price for which one can buy the most precious shell that the waves of
05:09:19 - 05:09:23
existence have ever yet washed on the shore.
05:09:23 - 05:09:29
As its owner, one becomes ever more refined in pain, and ultimately too refined.
05:09:29 - 05:09:35
Any small dejection and nausea was quite enough in the end to spoil life for Homer.
05:09:35 - 05:09:39
He had been unable to guess a foolish little riddle posed to him by some fisherman.
05:09:39 - 05:09:45
Yes, little riddles are the danger that confronts those who are happiest.
05:09:45 - 05:09:49
303 2.
05:09:50 - 05:09:57
Truly, in spite of his youth, this is a great improviser of life, who amazes even the subtlest
05:09:57 - 05:10:02
observer, for he never seems to make a mistake although he continually takes the greatest
05:10:02 - 05:10:03
risk.
05:10:03 - 05:10:07
One is reminded of those masters of musical improvisation whose hands the listener would
05:10:07 - 05:10:12
also like to credit with divine infallibility, although here and there they make a mistake
05:10:12 - 05:10:14
as every mortal does.
05:10:14 - 05:10:19
But they are practiced and inventive and ready at any moment to incorporate into their thematic
05:10:19 - 05:10:25
order the most accidental tone to which the flick of a finger or a mood has driven them,
05:10:25 - 05:10:29
breathing a beautiful meaning and a soul into an accident.
05:10:29 - 05:10:32
Here is an altogether different person.
05:10:32 - 05:10:36
At bottom, everything he desires and plans goes wrong.
05:10:36 - 05:10:40
What he has occasionally set his heart upon has brought him several times to the edge
05:10:40 - 05:10:44
of the abyss and within a hair of destruction.
05:10:44 - 05:10:48
But if he escaped that, it was certainly not merely with a black eye.
05:10:48 - 05:10:51
Do you suppose that he feels unhappy about that?
05:10:51 - 05:10:57
He made up his mind long ago not to take his own desires and plans too seriously.
05:10:57 - 05:11:03
If I do not succeed at this, he says to himself, I may perhaps succeed at that, and on the
05:11:03 - 05:11:07
whole I do not know whether I do not have more reason to be grateful to my failures
05:11:07 - 05:11:09
than to any success.
05:11:09 - 05:11:14
Was I made to be stubborn and to have horns like a bull?
05:11:14 - 05:11:19
What constitutes the value and result of life for me lies elsewhere.
05:11:19 - 05:11:22
My pride as well as my misery lie elsewhere.
05:11:22 - 05:11:27
I know more about life because I have so often been on the verge of losing it, and precisely
05:11:27 - 05:11:32
for that reason I get more out of life than any of you.
05:11:32 - 05:11:38
304 By doing we forego.
05:11:38 - 05:11:43
At bottom I abhor all those moralities which say, do not do this, renounce, overcome yourself,
05:11:43 - 05:11:48
but I am well disposed toward those moralities which goad me to do something and do it again,
05:11:48 - 05:11:52
from morning till evening, and then to dream of it at night, and to think of nothing except
05:11:52 - 05:11:57
doing this well, as well as I alone can do it.
05:11:57 - 05:12:01
When one lives like that, one thing after another that simply does not belong to such
05:12:01 - 05:12:03
a life drops off.
05:12:03 - 05:12:08
But hatred or aversion, one sees this take its leave today and that tomorrow, like yellow
05:12:08 - 05:12:13
leaves that any slight stirring of the air takes off a tree.
05:12:13 - 05:12:19
He may not even notice that it takes its leave, for his eye is riveted to his goal, forward,
05:12:19 - 05:12:22
not sideward, backward, downward.
05:12:22 - 05:12:24
What we do should determine what we forego.
05:12:24 - 05:12:26
By doing we forego.
05:12:26 - 05:12:30
That is how I like it, that is my placidum.
05:12:30 - 05:12:34
But I do not wish to strive with open eyes for my own impoverishment.
05:12:34 - 05:12:40
I do not like negative virtues, virtues whose very essence it is to negate and deny oneself
05:12:40 - 05:12:42
something.
05:12:42 - 05:12:45
305.
05:12:45 - 05:12:47
Self-control.
05:12:47 - 05:12:53
Those moralists who command man first of all and above all to gain control of himself thus
05:12:53 - 05:12:58
afflict him with a peculiar disease, namely, a constant irritability in the face of all
05:12:58 - 05:13:03
natural stirrings and inclinations, as it were, a kind of itching.
05:13:03 - 05:13:08
Whatever may henceforth push, pull, attract or impel such an irritable person from inside
05:13:08 - 05:13:13
or outside, it will always seem to him as if his self-control were endangered.
05:13:13 - 05:13:17
No longer may he entrust himself to any instinct or free wingbeat.
05:13:17 - 05:13:23
He stands in a fixed position, with a gesture that wards off, armed against himself, with
05:13:23 - 05:13:29
sharp and mistrustful eyes, the eternal guardian of his castle, since he has turned himself
05:13:29 - 05:13:30
into a castle.
05:13:30 - 05:13:35
Of course he can achieve greatness this way, but he has certainly become insufferable for
05:13:35 - 05:13:41
others, difficult for himself, and impoverished and cut off from the most beautiful fortuities
05:13:41 - 05:13:43
of his soul.
05:13:43 - 05:13:45
Also from all further instruction.
05:13:45 - 05:13:50
For one must be able to lose oneself occasionally, if one wants to learn something from things
05:13:50 - 05:13:53
different from oneself.
05:13:53 - 05:14:00
306 Stoics and Epicureans
05:14:00 - 05:14:04
The Epicurean selects the situation, the persons, and even the events that suit his extremely
05:14:04 - 05:14:06
irritable intellectual constitution.
05:14:06 - 05:14:09
He gives up all others, which means almost everything, because they would be too strong
05:14:09 - 05:14:12
and heavy for him to digest.
05:14:12 - 05:14:17
The Stoic, on the other hand, trains himself to swallow stones and worms, slivers of glass
05:14:17 - 05:14:20
and scorpions without nausea.
05:14:20 - 05:14:24
He wants his stomach to become ultimately indifferent to whatever the accidents of existence
05:14:24 - 05:14:26
might pour into it.
05:14:26 - 05:14:32
He reminds one of that Arabian sect of the Assaway, whom one encounters in Algiers.
05:14:32 - 05:14:39
Like these insensitive people, he, too, enjoys having an audience when he shows off his insensitivity,
05:14:39 - 05:14:44
while the Epicurean would rather dispense with that, having his garden.
05:14:44 - 05:14:49
For those with whom fate attempts improvisations, those who live in violent ages and depend
05:14:49 - 05:14:54
on sudden and mercurial people, Stoicism may indeed be advisable.
05:14:54 - 05:14:59
But anyone who foresees more or less that fate permits him to spin along three dues
05:14:59 - 05:15:02
well to make Epicurean arrangements.
05:15:02 - 05:15:06
That is what all those have always done whose work is of the spirit.
05:15:06 - 05:15:10
For this type it would be the loss of losses to be deprived of their subtle irritability
05:15:10 - 05:15:15
and be awarded in its place a hard Stoic hedgehog skin.
05:15:15 - 05:15:18

05:15:18 - 05:15:20
In Favor of Criticism
05:15:20 - 05:15:25
Now something that you formerly loved as a truth or probability strikes you as an error.
05:15:25 - 05:15:28
You shed it and fancy that this represents a victory for your reason.
05:15:28 - 05:15:32
But perhaps this error was as necessary for you then, when you were still a different
05:15:32 - 05:15:33
person.
05:15:33 - 05:15:39
You are always a different person, as are all your present truths, being a skin, as
05:15:39 - 05:15:43
it were, that concealed and covered a great deal that you were not yet permitted to see.
05:15:43 - 05:15:48
What killed that opinion for you was your new life, and not your reason.
05:15:48 - 05:15:54
You no longer need it, and now it collapses, and unreason crawls out of it, into the light
05:15:54 - 05:15:56
like a worm.
05:15:56 - 05:16:01
When we criticize something, this is no arbitrary and impersonal event.
05:16:01 - 05:16:05
It is, at least very often, evidence of vital energies in us that are growing and shedding
05:16:05 - 05:16:07
a skin.
05:16:07 - 05:16:12
We negate and must negate, because something in us wants to live and affirm.
05:16:12 - 05:16:16
Something that we perhaps do not know or see as yet.
05:16:16 - 05:16:20
This is said in favor of criticism.
05:16:20 - 05:16:22
308.
05:16:22 - 05:16:25
The History of Every Day
05:16:25 - 05:16:27
What is the history of every day in your case?
05:16:27 - 05:16:29
Look at your habits that constitute it.
05:16:29 - 05:16:34
Are they the product of innumerable little cowardices and lazinesses, or of your courage
05:16:34 - 05:16:36
and inventive reason?
05:16:36 - 05:16:41
However different these two cases are, people might very well praise you equally and you
05:16:41 - 05:16:44
might actually profit them equally this way and that.
05:16:44 - 05:16:49
But praise and profit and respectability may suffice those who merely wish to have a good
05:16:49 - 05:16:56
conscience, but not you, who try the heart, and reins, and make even conscience an object
05:16:56 - 05:16:58
of science.
05:16:58 - 05:17:03
309.
05:17:03 - 05:17:05
From the Seventh Soltude
05:17:05 - 05:17:10
One day the Wanderer slammed a door behind himself, stopped it in his tracks, and wept.
05:17:10 - 05:17:15
Then he said, This penchant and passion for what is true real, non apparent certain, how
05:17:15 - 05:17:17
it aggravates me.
05:17:17 - 05:17:21
Why does this gloomy and restless fellow keep following and driving me?
05:17:21 - 05:17:24
I want to rest, but he will not allow it.
05:17:24 - 05:17:28
How much there is that seduces me to tarry.
05:17:28 - 05:17:30
Everywhere Armida's gardens beckon me.
05:17:30 - 05:17:35
Everywhere I must keep tearing my heart away and experience new bitternesses.
05:17:35 - 05:17:39
I must raise my feet again and again, weary and wounded though they be.
05:17:39 - 05:17:44
And because I must go on, I often look back in wrath at the most beautiful things that
05:17:44 - 05:17:48
could not hold me, because they could not hold me.
05:17:48 - 05:17:51
310.
05:17:51 - 05:17:53
Will and Wave
05:17:53 - 05:17:58
How greedily this wave approaches, as if it were after something.
05:17:58 - 05:18:03
How it crawls with terrifying haste into the inmost nukes of this labyrinthine cliff.
05:18:03 - 05:18:05
It seems that it is trying to anticipate someone.
05:18:05 - 05:18:10
It seems that something of value, high value, must be hidden there.
05:18:10 - 05:18:15
And now it comes back, a little more slowly but still quite white with excitement.
05:18:15 - 05:18:17
Is it disappointed?
05:18:17 - 05:18:18
Has it found what it looked for?
05:18:18 - 05:18:20
Does it pretend to be disappointed?
05:18:20 - 05:18:26
But already another wave is approaching, still more greedily and savagely than the first.
05:18:26 - 05:18:32
And its soul, too, seems to be full of secrets and the lust to dig up treasures.
05:18:32 - 05:18:37
Thus live waves, thus live we who will, more I shall not say.
05:18:37 - 05:18:38
So?
05:18:38 - 05:18:40
You mistrust me?
05:18:40 - 05:18:43
You are angry with me, you beautiful monsters?
05:18:43 - 05:18:46
Are you afraid that I might give away your whole secret?
05:18:46 - 05:18:51
Well be angry with me, arch your dangerous green bodies as high as you can, raise a wall
05:18:51 - 05:18:55
between me and the sun, as you are doing now.
05:18:55 - 05:19:01
Truly, even now, nothing remains of the world but green twilight and green lightning.
05:19:01 - 05:19:07
Carry on as you like, roaring with overweening pleasure and malice, or dive again, pouring
05:19:07 - 05:19:12
your emeralds down into the deepest depths and throw your infinite white mane of foam
05:19:12 - 05:19:14
and spray over them.
05:19:14 - 05:19:19
Everything suits me, for everything suits you so well, and I am so well disposed toward
05:19:19 - 05:19:20
you for everything.
05:19:20 - 05:19:26
How could I think of betraying you, for, mark my word, I know you and your secret, I know
05:19:26 - 05:19:27
your kind.
05:19:27 - 05:19:30
You and I, are we not of one kind?
05:19:30 - 05:19:34
You and I, do we not have one secret?
05:19:34 - 05:19:37
311.
05:19:37 - 05:19:40
Refracted Light.
05:19:40 - 05:19:44
One is not always bold, and when one grows teary then one of you's too, is apt to moan
05:19:44 - 05:19:45
like this.
05:19:45 - 05:19:49
It is so hard to hurt people, oh why is it necessary?
05:19:49 - 05:19:53
What does it profit use to live in seclusion when we refuse to keep to ourselves?
05:19:53 - 05:19:55
What gives offense?
05:19:55 - 05:19:59
Would it not be more advisable to live in the swarm, and to make up to individuals the
05:20:00 - 05:20:03
sins that should and must be committed against all?
05:20:03 - 05:20:09
To be foolish with fools, vain with the vain, and enthusiastic with enthusiasts?
05:20:09 - 05:20:13
Wouldn't that be fair, given such overweening deviation on the whole?
05:20:13 - 05:20:20
When I hear of the malice of others against me, isn't my first reaction one of satisfaction?
05:20:20 - 05:20:21
Quite right.
05:20:21 - 05:20:27
I seem to be saying to them, I am so ill attuned to you and have so much truth on my side,
05:20:27 - 05:20:31
that you might as well have a good day at my expense whenever you can.
05:20:31 - 05:20:37
Here are my faults and blunders, here my delusion, my bad taste, my confusion, my tears, my vanity,
05:20:37 - 05:20:40
my olish seclusion, my contradictions.
05:20:40 - 05:20:42
Here you can laugh.
05:20:42 - 05:20:44
Laugh then, and be merry.
05:20:44 - 05:20:49
I do not resent the law and nature of things according to which faults and blunders cause
05:20:49 - 05:20:50
merriment.
05:20:50 - 05:20:55
To be sure, times used to be more beautiful, when anyone with a halfway new idea could
05:20:55 - 05:21:01
still feel so indispensable that he would go out into the street and shout at everyone,
05:21:01 - 05:21:04
Behold, the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
05:21:04 - 05:21:07
I should not miss myself if I were not there.
05:21:07 - 05:21:10
All of us are dispensable.
05:21:10 - 05:21:15
But to repeat it, that is not how we think when we are bold.
05:21:15 - 05:21:17
Then we don't think of this.
05:21:17 - 05:21:20
312.
05:21:20 - 05:21:22
My dog.
05:21:22 - 05:21:25
I have given a name to my pain and call it Dog.
05:21:25 - 05:21:30
It is just as faithful, just as obtrusive and shameless, just as entertaining, just
05:21:30 - 05:21:36
as clever as any other dog, and I can scold it and vent my bad mood on it, as others do
05:21:36 - 05:21:40
with their dogs, servants, and wives.
05:21:40 - 05:21:43
313.
05:21:43 - 05:21:45
No image of torture.
05:21:45 - 05:21:50
I want to proceed as Raphael did, and never paint another image of torture.
05:21:50 - 05:21:54
There are enough sublime things so that one does not have to look for the sublime where
05:21:54 - 05:22:01
it dwells in sisterly association with cruelty, and my ambition also could never find satisfaction
05:22:01 - 05:22:05
if I became a sublime assistant at torture.
05:22:05 - 05:22:09
314.
05:22:09 - 05:22:11
New domestic animals.
05:22:11 - 05:22:15
I want to have my lion and eagle near me so that I always have hints and omens that help
05:22:15 - 05:22:18
me to know how great or small my strength is.
05:22:18 - 05:22:22
Must I look down upon them today and feel fear?
05:22:22 - 05:22:24
And will the howler return when they look up to me?
05:22:24 - 05:22:26
In fear?
05:22:26 - 05:22:29
315.
05:22:29 - 05:22:31
On the last hour.
05:22:31 - 05:22:33
Storms are my danger.
05:22:33 - 05:22:39
Will I have my storm of which I will perish, as Oliver Cromwell perished of his storm?
05:22:39 - 05:22:43
Or will I go out like a light that no wind blows out but that becomes tired and sated
05:22:43 - 05:22:47
with itself, a burned-out light?
05:22:47 - 05:22:52
Or finally, will I blow myself out lest I burn out?
05:22:52 - 05:22:56
3 Moncine.
05:22:56 - 05:22:59
Prophetic human beings.
05:22:59 - 05:23:03
You have no feeling for the fact that prophetic human beings are afflicted with a great deal
05:23:03 - 05:23:05
of suffering.
05:23:05 - 05:23:09
You merely suppose that they have been granted a beautiful gift, and you would even like
05:23:09 - 05:23:11
to have it yourself.
05:23:11 - 05:23:14
But I shall express myself in a parable.
05:23:14 - 05:23:18
How much may animals suffer from the electricity in the air and the clouds?
05:23:18 - 05:23:24
We see how some species have a prophetic faculty regarding the weather, monkeys for example,
05:23:24 - 05:23:30
as may be observed even in Europe, and not only in zoos, namely on Gibraltar.
05:23:30 - 05:23:34
But we pay no heed that it is their pains that make them prophets.
05:23:34 - 05:23:39
When a strong positive electrical charge, under the influence of an approaching cloud
05:23:39 - 05:23:44
that is as yet far from visible, suddenly turns into negative electricity, and a change
05:23:44 - 05:23:49
of the weather is impending, these animals behave as if an enemy were drawing near and
05:23:49 - 05:23:51
prepare for defense or escape.
05:23:51 - 05:23:53
Most often, they try to hide.
05:23:53 - 05:23:58
They do not understand bad weather as a kind of weather, but as an enemy, whose hand they
05:23:58 - 05:24:01
already feel.
05:24:01 - 05:24:03
3.17.
05:24:03 - 05:24:09
Looking back, the true pathos of every period of our life rarely becomes clear to us as
05:24:09 - 05:24:11
long as we live in this period.
05:24:11 - 05:24:15
Then we always assume that it is the only state that is possible and reasonable for
05:24:15 - 05:24:22
us, and, to speak with the Greeks and adopt their distinction, an ethos and not a pathos.
05:24:22 - 05:24:28
A few musical chords reminded me today of a winter and a house and an extremely solitary
05:24:28 - 05:24:32
life, as well as the feeling in which I lived at that time.
05:24:32 - 05:24:35
I thought that I might go on living that way forever.
05:24:35 - 05:24:40
But now I comprehend that it was holy pathos and passion, and thus comparable to this painful
05:24:40 - 05:24:45
and bold music that was so certain that there was some comfort.
05:24:45 - 05:24:51
That sort of thing one must not have for years or for eternities, otherwise one would become
05:24:51 - 05:24:56
too superterrestrial for this planet.
05:24:56 - 05:25:00
3.18.
05:25:00 - 05:25:02
Wisdom in pain.
05:25:02 - 05:25:05
There is as much wisdom in pain as there is in pleasure.
05:25:05 - 05:25:10
Both belong among the factors that contribute the most to the preservation of the species.
05:25:10 - 05:25:14
If pain did not, it would have perished long ago.
05:25:14 - 05:25:18
That it hurts is no argument against it, but its essence.
05:25:18 - 05:25:23
In pain, I hear the captain's command, Take in the sails.
05:25:23 - 05:25:27
The bold seafarer, man must have mastered the art of doing a thousand things with his
05:25:27 - 05:25:28
sails.
05:25:28 - 05:25:33
Other ways he would be done for in no time, and the ocean would swallow him.
05:25:33 - 05:25:36
We must learn to live with diminished energies, too.
05:25:36 - 05:25:41
As soon as pain gives its safety signal, the time has come to diminish them.
05:25:41 - 05:25:46
Some great danger or other, a storm is approaching, and we are well advised to inflate ourselves
05:25:46 - 05:25:48
as little as possible.
05:25:48 - 05:25:54
True, there are people who hear precisely the opposite command when great pain approaches.
05:25:54 - 05:25:59
Their expression is never prouder, more warlike, and happier than it is when a storm comes
05:25:59 - 05:26:00
up.
05:26:00 - 05:26:04
Indeed, pain itself gives them their greatest moments.
05:26:04 - 05:26:10
This is the heroic type, the great pain bringers of humanity, those few or rare human beings
05:26:10 - 05:26:16
who need the very same apology that pain itself needs, and truly, one should not deny it to
05:26:16 - 05:26:17
them.
05:26:17 - 05:26:21
They contribute immensely to the preservation and enhancement of the species, even if it
05:26:21 - 05:26:27
were only by opposing comfortableness and by not concealing how this sort of happiness
05:26:27 - 05:26:30
nauseates them.
05:26:30 - 05:26:37
319 As Interpreters of Our Experiences
05:26:37 - 05:26:42
One sort of honesty has been alien to all founders of religions and their kind.
05:26:42 - 05:26:46
They have never made their experiences a matter of conscience for knowledge.
05:26:46 - 05:26:48
What did I really experience?
05:26:48 - 05:26:51
What happened in me and around me at that time?
05:26:51 - 05:26:52
Was my reason bright enough?
05:26:52 - 05:26:58
Was my will opposed to all deceptions of the senses and bold in resisting the fantastic?
05:26:58 - 05:27:03
None of them has asked such questions, nor do any of our dear religious people ask them
05:27:03 - 05:27:04
even now.
05:27:04 - 05:27:09
On the contrary, they thirst after things that go against reason, and they do not wish
05:27:09 - 05:27:15
to make it too hard for themselves to satisfy it, so they experience miracles and rebirths
05:27:15 - 05:27:18
and hear the voices of little angels.
05:27:18 - 05:27:24
But we, we others who thirst after reason, are determined to scrutinize our experiences
05:27:24 - 05:27:29
as severely as a scientific experiment, hour after hour, day after day.
05:27:29 - 05:27:32
day after day.
05:27:32 - 05:27:37
We ourselves wish to be our experiments and guinea pigs.
05:27:37 - 05:27:43
3 and 20 Upon seeing each other again, A, do I still
05:27:43 - 05:27:46
understand you well, you are seeking?
05:27:46 - 05:27:49
Where is your nook and star in the actual world?
05:27:49 - 05:27:54
Where can you lie down in the sun so that you, too, reap an excess of well-being, and
05:27:54 - 05:27:56
your existence justifies itself?
05:27:56 - 05:28:01
Let everyone do that for himself, you seem to me to be saying, and let everyone put out
05:28:01 - 05:28:06
of his mind generalities and worries about others and about society.
05:28:06 - 05:28:10
B, what I want is more.
05:28:10 - 05:28:11
I am no seeker.
05:28:11 - 05:28:15
I want to create for myself a son of my own.
05:28:15 - 05:28:19
3.21 New Caution
05:28:19 - 05:28:23
Let us stop thinking so much about punishing, reproaching, and improving others.
05:28:23 - 05:28:28
We rarely change an individual, and if we should succeed for once, something may also
05:28:28 - 05:28:30
have been accomplished, unnoticed.
05:28:30 - 05:28:33
We may have been changed by him.
05:28:33 - 05:28:38
Let us rather see to it that our own influence on all that is yet to come balances and outweighs
05:28:38 - 05:28:40
his influence.
05:28:40 - 05:28:45
Let us not contend in a direct fight, and that is what all reproaching, punishing, and
05:28:45 - 05:28:48
attempts to improve others amount to.
05:28:48 - 05:28:51
Let us rather raise ourselves that much higher.
05:28:51 - 05:28:54
Let us color our own example ever more brilliantly.
05:28:54 - 05:28:57
Let our brilliance make them look dark.
05:28:57 - 05:29:00
No, let us not become darker ourselves on their account.
05:29:00 - 05:29:04
Like ale those who punish others and feel dissatisfied.
05:29:04 - 05:29:05
Let us sooner step aside.
05:29:05 - 05:29:08
Let us look away.
05:29:08 - 05:29:13
322 Parable
05:29:13 - 05:29:19
Those thinkers in whom all stars move in cyclic orbits are not the most profound.
05:29:19 - 05:29:25
Whoever looks into himself as into vast space and carries galaxies in himself also knows
05:29:25 - 05:29:28
how irregular all galaxies are.
05:29:28 - 05:29:32
They lead into the chaos and labyrinth of existence.
05:29:32 - 05:29:36
323 Good luck in fate.
05:29:36 - 05:29:40
The greatest distinction that fate can bestow on us is to let us fight for a time on the
05:29:40 - 05:29:42
side of our opponents.
05:29:42 - 05:29:46
With that, we are predestined for a great victory.
05:29:46 - 05:29:50
924 In Media Vita
05:29:50 - 05:29:54
No, life has not disappointed me.
05:29:54 - 05:29:59
On the contrary, I find it truer, more desirable, and mysterious every year, ever since the
05:29:59 - 05:30:02
day when the great liberator came to me.
05:30:02 - 05:30:06
The idea that life could be an experiment of the seeker for knowledge, and not a duty,
05:30:06 - 05:30:10
not a calamity, not trickery.
05:30:10 - 05:30:11
And knowledge itself.
05:30:11 - 05:30:14
Let it be something else for others.
05:30:14 - 05:30:20
For example, a bed to rest on, or the way to such a bed, or a diversion, or a form of
05:30:20 - 05:30:21
leisure.
05:30:21 - 05:30:26
For me, it is a world of dangers and victories in which heroic feelings, too, find places
05:30:26 - 05:30:28
to dance and play.
05:30:28 - 05:30:31
Life as a means to knowledge.
05:30:31 - 05:30:36
With this principle in one's heart, one can live not only boldly, but even gaily.
05:30:36 - 05:30:38
And laugh gaily, too.
05:30:38 - 05:30:42
And who knows how to laugh anyway and live well if he does not first know a good deal
05:30:42 - 05:30:45
about war and victory?
05:30:45 - 05:30:51
325 What belongs to greatness?
05:30:51 - 05:30:55
Who will attain anything great if he does not find in himself the strength and the will
05:30:55 - 05:30:58
to inflict great suffering?
05:30:58 - 05:31:00
Being able to suffer is the least thing.
05:31:00 - 05:31:04
Weak women and even slaves often achieve virtuosity in that.
05:31:04 - 05:31:09
But not to perish of internal distress and uncertainty when one inflicts great suffering
05:31:09 - 05:31:15
and hears the cry of this suffering, that is great, that belongs to greatness.
05:31:15 - 05:31:23
326 The physicians of the soul and pain.
05:31:23 - 05:31:27
All preachers of morals as well as all theologians share one bad habit.
05:31:27 - 05:31:31
All of them try to con men into believing that they are in a very bad way and need some
05:31:31 - 05:31:34
ultimate, hard, radical cure.
05:31:34 - 05:31:39
Because humanity has listened to these teachers much too eagerly for whole centuries, something
05:31:39 - 05:31:43
of this superstition that they are in a very bad way has finally stuck.
05:31:43 - 05:31:49
Now they are only too ready to sigh, to find nothing good in life and to sulk together,
05:31:49 - 05:31:52
as if life were really hard to endure.
05:31:52 - 05:31:57
Actually, they are overwhelmingly sure of their life and in love with it, and they know
05:31:57 - 05:32:02
innumerable ruses and subtle tricks to vanquish what is disagreeable and to pull the fangs
05:32:02 - 05:32:05
of pain and misfortune.
05:32:05 - 05:32:10
It seems to me that people always exaggerate when they speak of pain and misfortune, as
05:32:10 - 05:32:15
if it were a requirement of good manners to exaggerate here, while one keeps studiously
05:32:15 - 05:32:21
quiet about the fact that there are innumerable palliatives against pain, such as anesthesia,
05:32:21 - 05:32:28
or the feverish haste of thoughts, or a quiet posture, or good or bad memories, purposes,
05:32:28 - 05:32:34
hopes, and many kinds of pride and sympathy that almost have the same effect as anesthetics.
05:32:34 - 05:32:39
And at the highest degrees of pain, one automatically loses consciousness.
05:32:39 - 05:32:44
We know quite well how to drip sweetnesses upon our bitternesses, especially the bitternesses
05:32:44 - 05:32:45
of the soul.
05:32:45 - 05:32:51
We find remedies in our courage and sublimity, as well as the nobler deliria of submission
05:32:51 - 05:32:53
and resignation.
05:32:53 - 05:32:56
A loss is a loss for barely one hour.
05:32:56 - 05:33:01
Somehow it also brings us some gift from heaven, new strength, for example, or at least a new
05:33:01 - 05:33:04
opportunity for strength.
05:33:04 - 05:33:10
What fantasies about the inner misery of evil people, moral preachers have invented?
05:33:10 - 05:33:14
What lies they have told us about the unhappiness of passionate people?
05:33:14 - 05:33:19
Lies, is really the proper word here, for they knew very well of the over-rich happiness
05:33:19 - 05:33:25
of this kind of human being, but they kept a deadly silence about it, because it refuted
05:33:25 - 05:33:31
their theory according to which all happiness begins only after the annihilation of passion
05:33:31 - 05:33:33
and the silencing of the will.
05:33:33 - 05:33:37
Finally, regarding the prescription of all these physicians of the soul and their praise
05:33:37 - 05:33:44
of a hard, radical cure, it should be permitted to ask, is our life really painful and burdensome
05:33:44 - 05:33:50
enough to make it advantageous to exchange it for a stoic way of life and petrification?
05:33:50 - 05:33:55
We are not so badly off that we have to be as badly off as stoics.
05:33:55 - 05:34:00
327 Taking Seriously
05:34:00 - 05:34:05
In the great majority, the intellect is a clumsy, gloomy, creaking machine that is difficult
05:34:05 - 05:34:06
to start.
05:34:06 - 05:34:10
They call it taking the matter seriously, when they want to work with this machine and
05:34:10 - 05:34:12
think well.
05:34:12 - 05:34:14
How burdensome they must find good thinking.
05:34:14 - 05:34:19
The lovely human beast always seems to lose its good spirits when it thinks well.
05:34:19 - 05:34:25
It becomes serious, and, where laughter and gaiety are found, thinking does not amount
05:34:25 - 05:34:26
to anything.
05:34:26 - 05:34:31
That is the prejudice of this serious beast against all gay science.
05:34:31 - 05:34:35
Well then, let us prove that this is a prejudice.
05:34:35 - 05:34:41
328 To Harm Stupidity
05:34:41 - 05:34:46
Surely the faith preached so stubbornly and with so much conviction that egoism is reprehensible
05:34:46 - 05:34:52
has on the whole harmed egoism, while benefiting, as I shall repeat a hundred times, the herd
05:34:52 - 05:34:53
instincts.
05:34:53 - 05:34:58
Above all, by depriving egoism of its good conscience and bidding us to find in it the
05:34:58 - 05:35:01
true source of all unhappiness.
05:35:01 - 05:35:05
Your selfishness is the misfortune of your life.
05:35:05 - 05:35:11
That was preached for thousands of years and harmed, as I have said, selfishness, and deprived
05:35:11 - 05:35:16
it of much spirit, much cheerfulness, much sensitivity, much beauty.
05:35:16 - 05:35:19
It made selfishness stupid and ugly and poisoned it.
05:35:19 - 05:35:25
The ancient philosophers taught that the main source of misfortune was something very different.
05:35:25 - 05:35:30
Beginning with Socrates, these thinkers never wearied of preaching.
05:35:30 - 05:35:36
Your thoughtlessness and stupidity, the way you live according to the rule, your submission
05:35:36 - 05:35:41
to your neighbor's opinion, is the reason why you so rarely achieve happiness.
05:35:41 - 05:35:46
We thinkers, as thinkers, are the happiest of all.
05:35:46 - 05:35:51
Let us not decide here whether this sermon against stupidity had better reasons on its
05:35:51 - 05:35:54
side than did the sermon against selfishness.
05:35:54 - 05:35:59
What is certain, however, is that it deprived stupidity of its good conscience.
05:35:59 - 05:36:02
These philosophers harmed stupidity.
05:36:02 - 05:36:05
329.
05:36:05 - 05:36:08
Leisure and idleness.
05:36:08 - 05:36:11
There is something of the American Indians, something of the ferocity peculiar to the
05:36:11 - 05:36:16
Indian blood, in the American lust for gold, and the breathless haste with which they work,
05:36:16 - 05:36:21
the distinctive vice of the new world, is already beginning to infect old Europe with
05:36:21 - 05:36:26
its ferocity and is spreading a lack of spirituality like a blanket.
05:36:26 - 05:36:33
Even now one is ashamed of resting, and prolonged reflection almost gives people a bad conscience.
05:36:33 - 05:36:38
One thinks with a watch in one's hand, even as one eats one's midday meal while reading
05:36:38 - 05:36:40
the latest news of the stock market.
05:36:40 - 05:36:45
One lives as if one always might miss out on something.
05:36:45 - 05:36:48
Rather do anything than nothing.
05:36:48 - 05:36:53
This principle, too, is merely a string to throttle all culture and good taste.
05:36:53 - 05:36:57
Just as all forms are visibly perishing by the haste of the workers, the feeling for
05:36:57 - 05:37:03
form itself, the ear and eye for the melody of movements are also perishing.
05:37:03 - 05:37:07
The proof of this may be found in the universal demand for gross obviousness in all those
05:37:07 - 05:37:13
situations in which human beings wish to be honest with one another for once.
05:37:13 - 05:37:19
In their associations with friends, women, relatives, children, teachers, pupils, leaders,
05:37:19 - 05:37:20
and princes.
05:37:20 - 05:37:26
One no longer has time or energy for ceremonies, for being obliging in an indirect way, for
05:37:26 - 05:37:30
a spree in conversation, and for any ochum at all.
05:37:30 - 05:37:35
Living in a constant chase after gain compels people to expend their spirit to the point
05:37:35 - 05:37:41
of exhaustion in continual pretense and overreaching and anticipating others.
05:37:41 - 05:37:46
Virtue has come to consist of doing something in less time than someone else.
05:37:46 - 05:37:51
Hours in which honesty is permitted have become rare, and when they arrive one is tired and
05:37:51 - 05:37:56
does not only want to let oneself go, but actually wishes to stretch out as long and
05:37:56 - 05:38:00
wide and ungainly as one happens to be.
05:38:00 - 05:38:04
This is how people now write letters, and the style and spirit of letters will always
05:38:04 - 05:38:07
be the true sign of the times.
05:38:07 - 05:38:13
If sociability and the arts still offer any delight, it is the kind of delight that slaves,
05:38:13 - 05:38:17
weary of their work, devise for themselves.
05:38:17 - 05:38:23
How frugal our educated and uneducated people have become regarding joy.
05:38:23 - 05:38:27
How they are becoming increasingly suspicious of all joy.
05:38:27 - 05:38:33
More and more, work enlists all good conscience on its side, the desire for joy already calls
05:38:33 - 05:38:39
itself a need to recuperate and is beginning to be ashamed of itself.
05:38:39 - 05:38:41
One owes it to one's health.
05:38:41 - 05:38:46
That is what people say when they are caught on an excursion into the country.
05:38:46 - 05:38:50
Soon we may well reach the point where people can no longer give in to the desire for a
05:38:50 - 05:38:56
vita contemplativa, that is, taking a walk with ideas and friends, without self-contempt
05:38:56 - 05:38:58
and a bad conscience.
05:38:58 - 05:39:01
Well, formerly it was the other way around.
05:39:01 - 05:39:04
It was work that was afflicted with the bad conscience.
05:39:04 - 05:39:08
A person of good family used to conceal the fact that he was working if need compelled
05:39:08 - 05:39:10
him to work.
05:39:10 - 05:39:15
Slaves used to work, oppressed by the feeling that they were doing something contemptible.
05:39:15 - 05:39:19
Doing itself was contemptible.
05:39:19 - 05:39:22
Nobility and honor are attached solely to odium and bellum.
05:39:22 - 05:39:25
That was the ancient prejudice.
05:39:25 - 05:39:27
330.
05:39:27 - 05:39:29
Applause.
05:39:29 - 05:39:35
A thinker needs no applause and clapping of hands if only he is assured of his own hand-clapping.
05:39:35 - 05:39:37
Without that, he cannot do.
05:39:37 - 05:39:42
Are there people who can dispense with that also and altogether with every kind of applause?
05:39:42 - 05:39:44
I doubt it.
05:39:44 - 05:39:50
Even about the wisest of men, Tacitus, who did not slander the wise, said, Quando etiam
05:39:50 - 05:39:57
sapientibus gloriae cupido novissima exuitur, which with him means never.
05:39:58 - 05:40:01
331.
05:40:01 - 05:40:03
Better deaf than deafened.
05:40:03 - 05:40:07
Formerly one wished to acquire fame and be spoken of.
05:40:07 - 05:40:11
Now that is no longer enough because the market has grown too large.
05:40:11 - 05:40:13
Nothing less than screaming will do.
05:40:13 - 05:40:18
As a consequence, even good voices scream till they are hoarse, and the best goods are
05:40:18 - 05:40:20
offered by cracked voices.
05:40:20 - 05:40:24
Without the screaming of those who want to sell and without hoarseness, there no longer
05:40:24 - 05:40:26
is any genius.
05:40:26 - 05:40:29
This is surely an evil age for a thinker.
05:40:29 - 05:40:34
He has to learn how to find his silence between two noises and to pretend to be deaf until
05:40:34 - 05:40:36
he really becomes deaf.
05:40:36 - 05:40:40
Until he has learned this, to be sure, he runs the risk of perishing of impatience and
05:40:40 - 05:40:42
headaches.
05:40:42 - 05:40:47
332.
05:40:47 - 05:40:49
The evil hour.
05:40:49 - 05:40:53
Every philosopher has probably had an evil hour when he thought, What do I matter if
05:40:53 - 05:40:57
one does not accept my bad arguments too?
05:40:57 - 05:41:02
And then some mischievous little bird flew past him and twittered, What do you matter?
05:41:02 - 05:41:06
What do you matter?
05:41:06 - 05:41:09
333.
05:41:09 - 05:41:11
The meaning of knowing.
05:41:11 - 05:41:17
Non ridere, non lugere, necce detestare, sed intelligere, says Spinoza as simply and sublimely
05:41:17 - 05:41:19
as is his wont.
05:41:19 - 05:41:23
Yet in the last analysis, what else is this intelligere than the form in which we come
05:41:23 - 05:41:26
to feel the other three at once?
05:41:26 - 05:41:33
One result of the different and mutually opposed desires to laugh, lament, and curse.
05:41:33 - 05:41:37
Before knowledge is possible, each of these instincts must first have presented its one-sided
05:41:37 - 05:41:40
view of the thing or event.
05:41:40 - 05:41:46
After this comes the fight of these one-sided views, and occasionally this results in a
05:41:46 - 05:41:52
mean, one grows calm, one finds all three sides right, and there is a kind of justice
05:41:52 - 05:41:54
and a contract.
05:41:54 - 05:42:00
For by virtue of justice and a contract, all these instincts can maintain their existence
05:42:00 - 05:42:03
and assert their rights against each other.
05:42:03 - 05:42:07
Since only the last scenes of reconciliation and the final accounting at the end of this
05:42:07 - 05:42:13
long process rise to our consciousness, we suppose that intelligere must be something
05:42:13 - 05:42:20
conciliatory, just, and good, something that stands essentially opposed to the instincts,
05:42:20 - 05:42:25
while it is actually nothing but a certain behavior of the instincts toward one another.
05:42:25 - 05:42:30
For the longest time, conscious thought was considered thought itself.
05:42:30 - 05:42:35
Only now does the truth dawn on us that by far the greatest part of our spirit's activity
05:42:35 - 05:42:38
remains unconscious and unfelt.
05:42:38 - 05:42:42
But I suppose that these instincts which are here contending against one another understand
05:42:42 - 05:42:48
very well how to make themselves felt by and how to hurt one another.
05:42:48 - 05:42:53
This may well be the source of that sudden and violent exhaustion that afflicts all thinkers.
05:42:53 - 05:42:56
It is the exhaustion on a battlefield.
05:42:56 - 05:43:02
Indeed, there may be occasions of concealed heroism in our warring depths, but certainly
05:43:02 - 05:43:07
nothing divine that eternally rests in itself, as Spinoza supposed.
05:43:07 - 05:43:12
Conscious thinking, especially that of the philosopher, is the least vigorous and therefore
05:43:12 - 05:43:18
also the relatively mildest and calmest form of thinking, and thus precisely philosophers
05:43:18 - 05:43:23
are most apt to be led astray about the nature of knowledge.
05:43:23 - 05:43:29
334 One must learn to love.
05:43:29 - 05:43:32
This is what happens to us in music.
05:43:32 - 05:43:36
First one has to learn to hear a figure and melody at all, to detect and distinguish it,
05:43:36 - 05:43:40
to isolate it, and delimit it as a separate life.
05:43:40 - 05:43:45
Then it requires some exertion and goodwill to tolerate it in spite of its strangeness,
05:43:45 - 05:43:51
to be patient with its appearance and expression, and kind-hearted about its oddity.
05:43:51 - 05:43:56
Finally there comes a moment when we are used to it, when we wait for it, when we sense
05:43:56 - 05:44:00
that we should miss it if it were missing, and now it continues to compel and enchant
05:44:00 - 05:44:06
us relentlessly until we have become its humble and enraptured lovers who desire nothing better
05:44:06 - 05:44:10
from the world than it and only it.
05:44:10 - 05:44:14
But that is what happens to us not only in music.
05:44:14 - 05:44:18
That is how we have learned to love all things that we now love.
05:44:18 - 05:44:23
In the end we are always rewarded for our goodwill, our patience, fair-mindedness, and
05:44:23 - 05:44:26
gentleness with what is strange.
05:44:26 - 05:44:32
Gradually it sheds its veil and turns out to be a new and indescribable beauty.
05:44:32 - 05:44:35
That is its thanks for our hospitality.
05:44:35 - 05:44:40
Even those who love themselves will have learned it in this way, for there is no other
05:44:40 - 05:44:41
way.
05:44:41 - 05:44:45
Love too has to be learned.
05:44:45 - 05:44:49
335 Long live physics!
05:44:49 - 05:44:52
How many people know how to observe something?
05:44:52 - 05:44:56
Of the few who do, how many observe themselves?
05:44:56 - 05:45:02
Everybody is farthest away from himself, all who try the reins know this to their chagrin,
05:45:02 - 05:45:08
and the maxim, Know thyself, addressed to human beings by a god, is almost malicious.
05:45:08 - 05:45:14
That the case of self-observation is indeed as desperate as that is attested best of all
05:45:14 - 05:45:20
by the manner in which almost everybody talks about the essence of moral actions, this quick,
05:45:20 - 05:45:25
eager, convinced, and garrulous manner with its expression, its smile, and its obliging
05:45:25 - 05:45:26
ardor.
05:45:26 - 05:45:34
One seems to have the wish to say to you, But my dear friend, precisely this is my specialty.
05:45:34 - 05:45:38
You have directed your question to the one person who is entitled to answer you.
05:45:38 - 05:45:43
As it happens, there is nothing about which I am as wise as about this.
05:45:43 - 05:45:50
To come to the point, when a human being judges this is right, and then infers, therefore
05:45:50 - 05:45:56
it must be done, and then proceeds to do what he has thus recognized as right and designated
05:45:56 - 05:46:00
as necessary, then the essence of his action is moral.
05:46:00 - 05:46:05
But my friend, you are speaking of three actions instead of one.
05:46:05 - 05:46:09
When you judge this is right, that is an action too.
05:46:09 - 05:46:13
Might it not be possible that one could judge in a moral and in an immoral manner?
05:46:13 - 05:46:17
Why do you consider this precisely this, right?
05:46:17 - 05:46:22
Because this is what my conscience tells me, and the voice of conscience is never immoral,
05:46:22 - 05:46:25
for it alone determines what is to be moral.
05:46:25 - 05:46:29
But why do you listen to the voice of your conscience?
05:46:29 - 05:46:33
And what gives you the right to consider such a judgment true and infallible?
05:46:33 - 05:46:36
For this faith, is there no conscience for that?
05:46:36 - 05:46:42
Have you never heard of an intellectual conscience, a conscience behind your conscience?
05:46:42 - 05:46:49
Your judgment, this is right, has a prehistory in your instincts, likes, dislikes, experiences,
05:46:49 - 05:46:52
and lack of experiences.
05:46:52 - 05:46:53
How did it originate there?
05:46:53 - 05:46:59
You must ask, and then also, what is it that impels me to listen to it?
05:46:59 - 05:47:04
You can listen to its commands like a good soldier who hears his officer's command,
05:47:04 - 05:47:09
or like a woman who loves the man who commands, or like a flatterer and coward who is afraid
05:47:09 - 05:47:14
of the commander, or like a dunderhead who obeys because no objection occurs to him.
05:47:14 - 05:47:19
In short, there are a hundred ways in which you can listen to your conscience.
05:47:19 - 05:47:25
But that you take this or that judgment for the voice of conscience, in other words, that
05:47:25 - 05:47:29
you feel something to be right, may be due to the fact that you have never thought much
05:47:29 - 05:47:34
about yourself and simply have accepted blindly that what you had been told ever since your
05:47:34 - 05:47:36
childhood was right.
05:47:36 - 05:47:41
Or it may be due to the fact that what you call your duty has up to this point brought
05:47:41 - 05:47:46
you sustenance and honors, and you consider it right because it appears to you as your
05:47:46 - 05:47:49
own condition of existence.
05:47:49 - 05:47:53
And that you have a right to existence seems irrefutable to you.
05:47:53 - 05:47:59
For all that, the firmness of your moral judgment could be evidence of your personal abjectness,
05:47:59 - 05:48:01
of impersonality.
05:48:01 - 05:48:05
Your moral strength might have its source in your stubbornness, or in your inability
05:48:05 - 05:48:07
to envisage new ideals.
05:48:07 - 05:48:13
And briefly, if you had thought more subtly, observed better, and learned more, you certainly
05:48:13 - 05:48:18
would not go on calling this duty of yours and this conscience of yours duty and conscience.
05:48:18 - 05:48:22
Your understanding of the manner in which moral judgments have originated would spoil
05:48:22 - 05:48:28
these grand words for you, just as other grand words, like sin and salvation of the soul
05:48:28 - 05:48:31
and redemption, have been spoiled for you.
05:48:31 - 05:48:35
And now don't cite the categorical imperative, my friend.
05:48:35 - 05:48:40
This term tickles my ear and makes me laugh despite your serious presence.
05:48:40 - 05:48:46
It makes me think of the old cant who had obtained the thing-in-itself by stealth, another
05:48:46 - 05:48:51
very ridiculous thing, and was punished for this when the categorical imperative crept
05:48:51 - 05:48:59
stealthily into his heart and led him astray, back to God, soul, freedom, and immortality,
05:48:59 - 05:49:03
like a fox who loses his way and goes astray back into his cage.
05:49:03 - 05:49:07
Yet it had been his strength and cleverness that had broken open the cage.
05:49:07 - 05:49:08
What?
05:49:08 - 05:49:12
You admire the categorical imperative within you?
05:49:12 - 05:49:15
This firmness of your so-called moral judgment?
05:49:15 - 05:49:19
This unconditional feeling that, here, everyone must judge as I do?
05:49:19 - 05:49:26
Rather, admire your selfishness at this point, and the blindness, pettiness, and frugality
05:49:26 - 05:49:28
of your selfishness.
05:49:28 - 05:49:33
For it is selfish to experience one's own judgment as a universal law, and this selfishness
05:49:33 - 05:49:40
is blind, petty, and frugal, because it betrays that you have not yet discovered yourself,
05:49:40 - 05:49:45
nor created for yourself, an ideal of your own, your very own, for that could never be
05:49:45 - 05:49:48
somebody else's, and much less that of all.
05:49:48 - 05:49:49
All.
05:49:49 - 05:49:54
Anyone who still judges, in this case everybody would have to act like this, has not yet taken
05:49:54 - 05:49:56
five steps towards self-knowledge.
05:49:56 - 05:50:03
Otherwise, he would know that there neither are nor can be actions that are the same.
05:50:03 - 05:50:07
That every action that has ever been done was done in an altogether unique and irretrievable
05:50:07 - 05:50:12
way, and that this will be equally true of every future action.
05:50:12 - 05:50:17
That all regulations about actions relate only to their coarse exterior, even the most
05:50:17 - 05:50:22
inward and subtle regulations of all moralities so far.
05:50:22 - 05:50:28
That these regulations may lead to some semblance of sameness, but really only to some semblance,
05:50:28 - 05:50:35
that as one contemplates or looks back upon any action at all, it is and remains impenetrable.
05:50:35 - 05:50:40
That our opinions about good and noble and great can never be proved true by our actions
05:50:40 - 05:50:43
because every action is unknowable.
05:50:43 - 05:50:47
That our opinions, valuations, and tables of what is good certainly belong among the
05:50:47 - 05:50:52
most powerful levers in the involved mechanism of our actions, but that in any particular
05:50:52 - 05:50:56
case the law of their mechanism is indemonstrable.
05:50:56 - 05:51:02
Let us therefore limit ourselves to the purification of our opinions and valuations and to the creation
05:51:02 - 05:51:07
of our own new tables of what is good, and let us stop brooding about the moral value
05:51:07 - 05:51:08
of our actions.
05:51:09 - 05:51:16
Yes, my friends, regarding all the moral chatter of some about others, it is time to feel nauseous.
05:51:16 - 05:51:19
Sitting in moral judgment should offend our taste.
05:51:19 - 05:51:24
Let us leave such chatter and such bad taste to those who have nothing else to do but drag
05:51:24 - 05:51:29
the past a few steps further through time and who never live in the present, which is
05:51:29 - 05:51:32
to say the many, the great majority.
05:51:32 - 05:51:40
We, however, want to become those we are, human beings who are new, unique, incomparable,
05:51:40 - 05:51:44
who give themselves laws, who create themselves.
05:51:44 - 05:51:48
To that end, we must become the best learners and discoverers of everything that is lawful
05:51:48 - 05:51:50
and necessary in the world.
05:51:50 - 05:51:55
We must become physicists in order to be able to be creators in this sense.
05:51:55 - 05:52:00
While hitherto all valuations and ideals have been based on ignorance of physics or were
05:52:00 - 05:52:06
constructed so as to contradict it, therefore long live physics, and even more so that which
05:52:06 - 05:52:11
compels us to turn to physics, our honesty.
05:52:11 - 05:52:16
336 Nature's Stinginess
05:52:16 - 05:52:22
Why has nature been so stingy with human beings that it did not allow them to shine, one more,
05:52:22 - 05:52:25
one less, each according to the plenitude of his own light?
05:52:25 - 05:52:30
Why are great human beings not as beautifully visible in their rise and setting as the sun?
05:52:30 - 05:52:34
How much more unambiguous that would make all life among men.
05:52:39 - 05:52:42
The Humaneness of the Future
05:52:42 - 05:52:47
When I contemplate the present age with the eyes of some remote age, I can find nothing
05:52:47 - 05:52:52
more remarkable in present-day humanity than its distinctive virtue and disease, which
05:52:52 - 05:52:55
goes by the name of the historical sense.
05:52:55 - 05:52:59
This is the beginning of something altogether new and strange in history.
05:52:59 - 05:53:04
If this seed should be given a few centuries and more, it might ultimately become a marvelous
05:53:04 - 05:53:09
growth with an equally marvelous scent that might make our old earth more agreeable to
05:53:09 - 05:53:10
live on.
05:53:10 - 05:53:15
We of the present day are only just beginning to form the chain of a very powerful future
05:53:15 - 05:53:18
feeling, link for link.
05:53:18 - 05:53:20
We hardly know what we are doing.
05:53:20 - 05:53:25
It almost seems to us as if it were not a matter of a new feeling but rather a decrease
05:53:25 - 05:53:27
in all old feelings.
05:53:27 - 05:53:32
The historical sense is still so poor and cold, and many people are attacked by it as
05:53:32 - 05:53:36
by a frost and made still poorer and colder.
05:53:36 - 05:53:41
To others it appears as a sign of stealthily approaching old age, and they see our planet
05:53:41 - 05:53:45
as a melancholy invalid who wants to forget his present condition and therefore writes
05:53:45 - 05:53:47
the history of his youth.
05:53:47 - 05:53:51
This is actually one color of this new feeling.
05:53:51 - 05:53:56
Anyone who manages to experience the history of humanity as a whole as his own history
05:53:56 - 05:54:01
will feel in an enormously generalized way all the grief of an invalid who thinks of
05:54:01 - 05:54:07
health, of an old man who thinks of the dreams of his youth, of a lover deprived of his beloved,
05:54:07 - 05:54:12
of the martyr whose ideal is perishing, of the hero on the evening after a battle that
05:54:12 - 05:54:17
has decided nothing but brought him wounds and the loss of his friend.
05:54:17 - 05:54:22
But if one endured, if one could endure this immense sum of grief of all kinds while yet
05:54:22 - 05:54:28
being the hero who, as the second day of battle breaks, welcomes the dawn and his fortune,
05:54:28 - 05:54:34
being a person whose horizon encompasses thousands of years past and future, being the heir of
05:54:34 - 05:54:41
all the nobility of all past spirit, an heir with a sense of obligation, the most aristocratic
05:54:41 - 05:54:46
of old nobles and at the same time the first of a new nobility, the like of which no age
05:54:46 - 05:54:52
has yet seen or dreamed of, if one could burden one's soul with all of this, the oldest,
05:54:52 - 05:54:59
the newest, losses, hopes, conquests and the victories of humanity, if one could finally
05:54:59 - 05:55:05
contain all this in one's soul and crowd it into a single feeling, this would surely have
05:55:05 - 05:55:10
to result in a happiness that humanity has not known so far, the happiness of a God full
05:55:10 - 05:55:16
of power and love, full of tears and laughter, a happiness that, like the sun in the evening,
05:55:16 - 05:55:22
continually bestows its inexhaustible riches, pouring them into the sea, feeling richest as
05:55:22 - 05:55:27
the sun does, only when even the poorest fisherman is still rowing with golden oars,
05:55:27 - 05:55:37
this God-like feeling would then be called humaneness. 338. The will to suffer and those
05:55:37 - 05:55:44
who feel pity. Is it good for you yourselves to be above all full of pity? And is it good
05:55:44 - 05:55:50
for those who suffer? But let us leave the first question unanswered for a moment. Our personal
05:55:50 - 05:55:56
and profoundest suffering is incomprehensible and inaccessible to almost everyone. Here we
05:55:56 - 05:56:02
remain hidden from our neighbor, even if we eat from one pot. But whenever people notice that we
05:56:02 - 05:56:09
suffer, they interpret our suffering superficially. It is the very essence of the emotion of pity
05:56:09 - 05:56:16
that it strips away from the suffering of others, whatever is distinctively personal. Our benefactors
05:56:16 - 05:56:24
are, more than our enemies, people who make our worth and will smaller. When people try to benefit
05:56:24 - 05:56:30
someone in distress, the intellectual frivolity with which those moved by pity assume the role
05:56:30 - 05:56:37
of fate is for the most part outrageous. One simply knows nothing of the whole inner sequence
05:56:37 - 05:56:43
and intricacies that are distress for me or for you. The whole economy of my soul and the balance
05:56:43 - 05:56:49
affected by distress, the way new springs and needs break open, the way in which old wounds
05:56:49 - 05:56:54
are healing, the way whole periods of the past are shed. All such things that may be involved
05:56:54 - 05:56:59
in distress are of no concern to our dear pitying friends. They wish to help and have no thought of
05:56:59 - 05:57:06
the personal necessity of distress, although terrors, deprivations, impoverishments, midnights,
05:57:06 - 05:57:13
adventures, risks, and blunders are as necessary for me and for you as are their opposites. It
05:57:13 - 05:57:18
never occurs to them that, to put it mystically, the path to one's own heaven always leads through
05:57:18 - 05:57:26
the voluptuousness of one's own hell. No, the religion of pity or the heart commands them to
05:57:26 - 05:57:33
help, and they believe that they have helped most when they have helped most quickly. If you,
05:57:33 - 05:57:38
who adhere to this religion, have the same attitude toward yourselves that you have toward
05:57:38 - 05:57:44
your fellow men, if you refuse to let your own suffering lie upon you even for an hour, and if
05:57:44 - 05:57:50
you constantly try to prevent and forestall all possible distress way ahead of time, if you
05:57:50 - 05:57:56
experience suffering and displeasure as evil, hateful, worthy of annihilation, and as a defect
05:57:56 - 05:58:02
of existence, then it is clear that besides your religion of pity you also harbor another religion
05:58:02 - 05:58:08
in your heart, that is perhaps the mother of the religion of pity, the religion of comfortableness.
05:58:08 - 05:58:14
How little you know of human happiness, you comfortable and benevolent people, for happiness
05:58:14 - 05:58:19
and unhappiness are sisters and even twins that either grow up together or, as in your case,
05:58:19 - 05:58:27
remain small together. But now back to the first question. How is it at all possible to keep to
05:58:27 - 05:58:34
one's own way? Constantly some clamor or other calls us aside. Rarely does our eye behold anything
05:58:34 - 05:58:40
that does not require us to drop our own preoccupation instantly to help. I know there
05:58:40 - 05:58:45
are a hundred decent and praiseworthy ways of losing my own way, and they are truly highly
05:58:45 - 05:58:51
moral. Indeed, those who now preach the morality of pity even take the view that precisely this
05:58:51 - 05:58:57
and only this is moral, to lose one's own way in order to come to the assistance of a neighbor.
05:58:57 - 05:59:03
I know just as certainly that I only need to expose myself to the sight of some genuine
05:59:03 - 05:59:09
distress and I am lost. And if a suffering friend said to me, look, I am about to die,
05:59:09 - 05:59:15
please promise me to die with me. I should promise it. And the sight of a small mountain
05:59:15 - 05:59:22
tribe fighting for its liberty would persuade me to offer it my hand and my life. If for good
05:59:22 - 05:59:27
reasons I may choose for once too bad examples. All such a rousing of pity and calling for help
05:59:27 - 05:59:33
is secretly seductive, for our own way is too hard and demanding and too remote from the love
05:59:33 - 05:59:39
and gratitude of others. And we do not really mind escaping from it and from our very own
05:59:39 - 05:59:45
conscience, to flee into the conscience of the others and into the lovely temple of the religion
05:59:45 - 05:59:51
of pity. As soon as any war breaks out anywhere, there also breaks out precisely among the noblest
05:59:51 - 05:59:58
people, a pleasure that to be sure is kept secret. Rapturously, they throw themselves into the new
05:59:58 - 06:00:04
danger of death because the sacrifice for the fatherland seems to them to offer the long desired
06:00:04 - 06:00:11
permission to dodge their goal. War offers them a detour to suicide, but a detour with a good
06:00:11 - 06:00:16
conscience. And while I shall keep silent about some points, I do not want to remain silent about
06:00:16 - 06:00:25
my morality, which says to me, live in seclusion so that you can live for yourself. Live in ignorance
06:00:25 - 06:00:31
about what seems most important to your age. Between yourself and today lay the skin of at
06:00:31 - 06:00:38
least three centuries, and the clamor of today, the noise of wars and revolutions, should be a
06:00:38 - 06:00:45
mere murmur for you. You will also wish to help, but only those whose distress you understand
06:00:45 - 06:00:51
entirely because they share with you one suffering and one hope, your friends, and only in the manner
06:00:52 - 06:00:59
in which you help yourself. I want to make them bolder, more persevering, simpler, gayer. I want
06:00:59 - 06:01:05
to teach them what is understood by so few today, least of all by these preachers of pity, to share
06:01:05 - 06:01:16
not suffering but joy. 339. Vida Femina. For seeing the ultimate beauties of a work, no knowledge or
06:01:16 - 06:01:21
goodwill is sufficient. This requires the rarest of lucky accidents. The clouds that veil these
06:01:21 - 06:01:27
peaks have to lift for once so that we see them glowing in the sun. Not only do we have to stand
06:01:27 - 06:01:32
in precisely the right spot in order to see this, but the unveiling must have been accomplished by
06:01:32 - 06:01:37
our own soul, because it needed some external expression and parable, as if it were a matter
06:01:37 - 06:01:42
of having something to hold on to and retain control of itself. But it is so rare for all
06:01:42 - 06:01:48
of this to coincide that I am inclined to believe that the highest peaks of everything good, whether
06:01:48 - 06:01:55
it be a work, a deed, humanity, or nature, have so far remained concealed and veiled from the
06:01:55 - 06:02:00
great majority and even from the best human beings. But what does unveil itself for us,
06:02:00 - 06:02:05
unveils itself for us once only. The Greeks, to be sure, prayed,
06:02:05 - 06:02:11
everything beautiful twice and even three times. They implored the gods with good reason,
06:02:11 - 06:02:19
for ungodly reality gives us the beautiful either not at all or once only. I mean to say that the
06:02:19 - 06:02:24
world is over full of beautiful things but nevertheless poor, very poor, when it comes
06:02:24 - 06:02:30
to beautiful moments and unveilings of these things. But perhaps this is the most powerful
06:02:30 - 06:02:36
magic of life. It is covered by a veil interwoven with gold, a veil of beautiful possibilities,
06:02:36 - 06:02:45
sparkling with promise, resistance, bashfulness, mockery, pity, and seduction. Yes, life is a woman.
06:02:45 - 06:02:51
340 The Dying Socrates
06:02:51 - 06:02:58
I admire the courage and wisdom of Socrates in everything he did, said, and did not say.
06:02:58 - 06:03:04
This mocking and enamored monster and pied piper of Athens, who made the most overweening youths
06:03:04 - 06:03:10
tremble and sob, was not only the wisest chatterer of all time, he was equally great in silence.
06:03:10 - 06:03:17
I wish he had remained taciturn also at the last moment of his life, in that case he might
06:03:17 - 06:03:23
belong to a still higher order of spirits. Whether it was death or the poison or piety
06:03:23 - 06:03:27
or malice, something loosened his tongue at that moment and he said,
06:03:27 - 06:03:35
O Crito, I owe Asclepius a rooster. This ridiculous and terrible last word means
06:03:35 - 06:03:43
for those who have ears, O Crito, life is a disease. Is it possible that a man like him,
06:03:43 - 06:03:48
who had lived cheerfully and like a soldier in the sight of everyone, should have been a pessimist?
06:03:48 - 06:03:54
He had merely kept a cheerful mien while concealing all his lifelong, his ultimate judgment,
06:03:54 - 06:04:01
his inmost feeling. Socrates, Socrates suffered life and then he still revenged himself with this
06:04:01 - 06:04:07
veiled, gruesome, pious and blasphemous saying. Did a Socrates need such revenge? Did his overrich
06:04:07 - 06:04:14
virtue lack an ounce of magnanimity? Alas, my friends, we must overcome even the Greeks.
06:04:14 - 06:04:19
341. The Greatest Weight.
06:04:19 - 06:04:25
What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say
06:04:25 - 06:04:30
to you, This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and
06:04:30 - 06:04:36
innumerable times more, and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every
06:04:36 - 06:04:42
thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you,
06:04:42 - 06:04:48
all in the same succession and sequence, even this spider and this moonlight between the trees,
06:04:48 - 06:04:55
and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down
06:04:55 - 06:05:02
again and again, and you with it, speck of dust. Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your
06:05:02 - 06:05:08
teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you
06:05:08 - 06:05:15
would have answered him, You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine. If this thought
06:05:15 - 06:05:22
gained possession of you, it would change you as you are, or perhaps crush you. The question in
06:05:22 - 06:05:28
each and every thing, Do you desire this once more and innumerable times more, would lie upon
06:05:28 - 06:05:33
your actions as the greatest weight, or how well disposed would you have to become to yourself and
06:05:33 - 06:05:38
to life to crave nothing more fervently than this ultimate eternal confirmation and seal.
06:05:38 - 06:05:49
342. Incipit Triguitia. When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home in Lake
06:05:49 - 06:05:55
Urmi and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and his solitude, and for ten years did
06:05:55 - 06:06:02
not tire of that. But at last his heart changed, and one morning he rose with the dawn, stepped
06:06:02 - 06:06:09
before the sun, and spoke to it thus. You great star, what would your happiness be if you did not
06:06:09 - 06:06:15
have those for whom you shine? For ten years you have climbed up to my cave. You would have become
06:06:15 - 06:06:21
weary of your light and of the journey had it not been for me and my eagle and my serpent. But we
06:06:21 - 06:06:29
waited for you every morning, took your overflow from you, and blessed you for it. Behold, I am
06:06:29 - 06:06:35
sick of my wisdom, like a bee that has gathered too much honey. I need hands outstretched to
06:06:35 - 06:06:40
receive it. I want to give away and distribute until the wise among men enjoy their folly once
06:06:40 - 06:06:47
again and the poor their riches. For that I must descend to the depths, as you do in the evening
06:06:47 - 06:06:53
when you go behind the sea and still bring light to the underworld, you over-rich star. Like you,
06:06:53 - 06:06:59
I must go under, as men put it, to whom I wish to descend. Bless me then, you calm eye that can
06:06:59 - 06:07:05
look without envy even upon an all-too-great happiness. Bless the cup that wants to overflow,
06:07:05 - 06:07:11
in order that the water may flow from it golden and carry the reflection of your rapture everywhere.
06:07:11 - 06:07:17
Behold, this cup wants to become empty again, and Zarathustra wants to become man again."
06:07:17 - 06:07:23
Thus, Zarathustra began to go under. Book 5
06:07:23 - 06:07:32
We fearless ones, carcass, tu trembles, tu tremblerais bien davantage si tu savais où
06:07:32 - 06:07:41
je te mène. Turin. 3.43. The meaning of our cheerfulness. The greatest recent event,
06:07:41 - 06:07:46
that God is dead, that the belief in the Christian God has become unbelievable,
06:07:46 - 06:07:52
is already beginning to cast its first shadows over Europe. For the few, at least, whose eyes,
06:07:52 - 06:07:59
the suspicion in whose eyes is strong and subtle enough for this spectacle. Some sun seems to have
06:07:59 - 06:08:05
set, and some ancient and profound trust has been turned into doubt. To them, our old world must
06:08:06 - 06:08:13
appear daily more like evening, more mistrustful, stronger, older. But in the main, one may say,
06:08:13 - 06:08:21
Thy event itself is far too great, too distant, too remote from the multitude's capacity for
06:08:21 - 06:08:26
comprehension even for the tittings of it to be thought of as having arrived as yet. Much
06:08:26 - 06:08:32
less may one suppose that many people know as yet what this event really means, and how much
06:08:32 - 06:08:37
must collapse now that this faith has been undermined because it was built upon this faith,
06:08:37 - 06:08:45
propped up by it, grown into it. For example, the whole of our European morality. This long
06:08:45 - 06:08:52
plenitude and sequence of breakdown, destruction, ruin, and cataclysm that is now impending. Who
06:08:52 - 06:08:56
could guess enough of it today to be compelled to play the teacher and advanced proclaimer of
06:08:56 - 06:09:01
this monstrous logic of terror, the prophet of a gloom and an eclipse of the sun whose like has
06:09:01 - 06:09:07
probably never yet occurred on earth? Even we born guessers of riddles who are, as it were,
06:09:07 - 06:09:13
waiting on the mountains, posted between today and tomorrow, stretched in the contradiction
06:09:13 - 06:09:17
between today and tomorrow, we firstlings and premature births of the coming century,
06:09:17 - 06:09:22
to whom the shadows that must soon envelop Europe really should have appeared by now.
06:09:22 - 06:09:27
Why is it that even we look forward to the approaching gloom without any real sense of
06:09:27 - 06:09:35
involvement, and above all, without any worry and fear for ourselves? Are we perhaps still too
06:09:35 - 06:09:39
much under the impression of the initial consequences of this event? And these initial
06:09:39 - 06:09:44
consequences, the consequences for ourselves, are quite the opposite of what one might perhaps
06:09:44 - 06:09:50
expect. They are not at all sad and gloomy, but rather like a new and scarcely describable kind
06:09:50 - 06:09:57
of light, happiness, relief, exhilaration, encouragement, dawn. Indeed, we philosophers
06:09:57 - 06:10:04
and free spirits feel, when we hear the news that the old God is dead, as if a new dawn shone on us.
06:10:04 - 06:10:12
Our heart overflows with gratitude, amazement, premonitions, expectation. At long last,
06:10:12 - 06:10:18
the horizon appears free to us again, even if it should not be bright. At long last,
06:10:18 - 06:10:23
our ships may venture out again, venture out to face any danger. All the daring of the lover
06:10:23 - 06:10:30
of knowledge is permitted again. The sea, our sea, lies open again. Perhaps there has never
06:10:30 - 06:10:39
yet been such an open sea. 344. How We Too Are Still Pious.
06:10:39 - 06:10:44
In science, convictions have no rights of citizenship, as one says with good reason,
06:10:44 - 06:10:50
only when they decide to descend to the modesty of hypotheses, of a provisional experimental point
06:10:50 - 06:10:57
of view, of a regulative fiction, they may be granted admission and even a certain value in
06:10:57 - 06:11:01
the realm of knowledge, though always with the restriction that they remain under police
06:11:01 - 06:11:07
supervision, under the police of mistrust. But does this not mean, if you consider it
06:11:07 - 06:11:09
more precisely, that a conviction is a crime?
06:11:09 - 06:11:14
Conviction may obtain admission to science only when it ceases to be a conviction.
06:11:14 - 06:11:18
Would it not be the first step in the discipline of the scientific spirit that one would not
06:11:18 - 06:11:21
permit oneself any more convictions?
06:11:21 - 06:11:23
Probably this is so.
06:11:23 - 06:11:25
Only we still have to ask.
06:11:25 - 06:11:31
To make it possible for this discipline to begin, must there not be some prior conviction?
06:11:31 - 06:11:37
Even one that is so commanding and unconditional that it sacrifices all other convictions to
06:11:37 - 06:11:38
itself?
06:11:38 - 06:11:41
We see that science also rests on a faith.
06:11:41 - 06:11:46
There simply is no science without presuppositions.
06:11:46 - 06:11:50
The question whether truth is needed must not only have been affirmed in advance, but
06:11:50 - 06:11:57
affirmed to such a degree that the principle, the faith, the conviction, finds expression.
06:11:57 - 06:12:01
Nothing is needed more than truth, and in relation to it everything else has only second
06:12:01 - 06:12:04
rate value.
06:12:04 - 06:12:07
This unconditional will to truth, what is it?
06:12:07 - 06:12:13
Is it the will not to allow oneself to be deceived, or is it the will not to deceive?
06:12:13 - 06:12:17
For the will to truth could be interpreted in the second way too.
06:12:17 - 06:12:23
If only the special case, I do not want to deceive myself, is subsumed under the generalization,
06:12:23 - 06:12:25
I do not want to deceive.
06:12:25 - 06:12:27
But why not deceive?
06:12:27 - 06:12:30
But why not allow oneself to be deceived?
06:12:30 - 06:12:34
Note that the reasons for the former principle belong to an altogether different realm from
06:12:34 - 06:12:36
those for the second.
06:12:36 - 06:12:42
One does not want to allow oneself to be deceived because one assumes that it is harmful, dangerous,
06:12:42 - 06:12:45
calamitous to be deceived.
06:12:45 - 06:12:51
In this sense, science would be a long-range prudence, a caution, a utility, but one could
06:12:51 - 06:12:53
object in all fairness.
06:12:53 - 06:12:55
How is that?
06:12:55 - 06:13:00
Is wanting not to allow oneself to be deceived really less harmful, less dangerous, less
06:13:00 - 06:13:01
calamitous?
06:13:01 - 06:13:06
What do you know in advance of the character of existence to be able to decide whether
06:13:06 - 06:13:12
the greater advantage is on the side of the unconditionally mistrustful or of the unconditionally
06:13:12 - 06:13:13
trusting?
06:13:13 - 06:13:18
But if both should be required, much trust as well as much mistrust, from where would
06:13:18 - 06:13:24
science then be permitted to take its unconditional faith or conviction on which it rests, that
06:13:24 - 06:13:29
truth is more important than any other thing, including every other conviction?
06:13:29 - 06:13:34
Precisely this conviction could never have come into being if both truth and untruth constantly
06:13:34 - 06:13:38
proved to be useful, which is the case.
06:13:38 - 06:13:44
Thus, the faith in science, which after all exists undeniably, cannot owe its origin to
06:13:44 - 06:13:47
such a calculus of utility.
06:13:47 - 06:13:52
It must have originated in spite of the fact that the disutility and dangerousness of the
06:13:52 - 06:13:57
will to truth, of truth at any price, is proved to it constantly.
06:13:57 - 06:14:02
At any price, how well we understand these words once we have offered and slaughtered
06:14:02 - 06:14:05
one faith after another on this altar.
06:14:05 - 06:14:11
Consequently, will to truth does not mean I will not allow myself to be deceived, but
06:14:11 - 06:14:13
there is no alternative.
06:14:13 - 06:14:16
I will not deceive, not even myself.
06:14:16 - 06:14:19
And with that, we stand on moral ground.
06:14:19 - 06:14:25
For you only have to ask yourself carefully, why do you not want to deceive?
06:14:25 - 06:14:30
Especially if it should seem, and it does seem, as if life aimed at semblance, meaning
06:14:30 - 06:14:35
error, deception, simulation, delusion, self-delusion, and when the great sweep of life has actually
06:14:35 - 06:14:41
always shown itself to be on the side of the most unscrupulous polytropoi.
06:14:41 - 06:14:46
Charitably interpreted, such a resolve might perhaps be a quixotism, a minor slightly mad
06:14:46 - 06:14:52
enthusiasm, but it might also be something more serious, namely, a principle that is
06:14:52 - 06:14:56
hostile to life and destructive.
06:14:56 - 06:15:00
Will to truth, that might be a concealed will to death.
06:15:00 - 06:15:04
Thus the question, why science, leads back to the moral problem.
06:15:04 - 06:15:10
Why have morality at all when life, nature, and history are not moral?
06:15:10 - 06:15:15
No doubt, those who are truthful in that audacious and ultimate sense that is presupposed by
06:15:15 - 06:15:20
the faith in science thus affirm another world than the world of life, nature, and history.
06:15:20 - 06:15:26
And insofar as they affirm this other world, look, must they not by the same token negate
06:15:26 - 06:15:30
its counterpart, this world, our world?
06:15:30 - 06:15:35
But you will have gathered what I am driving at, namely, that it is still a metaphysical
06:15:35 - 06:15:41
faith upon which our faith in science rests, that even we seekers after knowledge today,
06:15:41 - 06:15:47
we godless anti-metaphysicians still take our fire, too, from the flame lit by a faith
06:15:47 - 06:15:52
that is thousands of years old, that Christian faith which was also the faith of Plato, that
06:15:52 - 06:15:56
God is the truth, that truth is divine.
06:15:56 - 06:16:00
But what if this should become more and more incredible, if nothing should prove to be
06:16:00 - 06:16:06
divine anymore unless it were error, blindness, the lie, if God himself should prove to be
06:16:06 - 06:16:09
our most enduring lie?
06:16:09 - 06:16:12
345.
06:16:12 - 06:16:14
Morality is a problem.
06:16:14 - 06:16:18
The lack of personality always takes its revenge.
06:16:18 - 06:16:23
A weakened, thin, extinguished personality that denies itself is no longer fit for anything
06:16:23 - 06:16:27
good, least of all for philosophy.
06:16:27 - 06:16:30
Selflessness has no value either in heaven or on earth.
06:16:30 - 06:16:35
All great problems demand great love, and of that only strong, round, secure spirits
06:16:35 - 06:16:38
who have a firm grip on themselves are capable.
06:16:38 - 06:16:42
It makes the most telling difference whether a thinker has a personal relationship to his
06:16:42 - 06:16:48
problems and finds in them his destiny, his distress, and his greatest happiness, or an
06:16:48 - 06:16:53
impersonal one, meaning that he can do no better than to touch them and grasp them with
06:16:53 - 06:16:56
the antennae of cold, curious thought.
06:16:56 - 06:16:58
In the latter case, nothing will come of it.
06:16:58 - 06:17:03
That much one can promise in advance, for even if great problems should allow themselves
06:17:03 - 06:17:08
to be grasped by them, they would not permit frogs and weaklings to hold on to them.
06:17:08 - 06:17:14
Such has been their taste from time immemorial, a taste, incidentally, that they share with
06:17:14 - 06:17:16
all redoubtable females.
06:17:16 - 06:17:21
Why is it then that I have never yet encountered anybody, not even in books, who approached
06:17:21 - 06:17:26
morality in this personal way, and who knew morality as a problem, and this problem as
06:17:26 - 06:17:33
his own personal distress, torment, voluptuousness, and passion?
06:17:33 - 06:17:38
It is evident that up to now morality was no problem at all, but on the contrary, precisely
06:17:38 - 06:17:45
that on which, after all, mistrust, discord, and contradiction, one could agree.
06:17:45 - 06:17:50
The hallowed place of peace where our thinkers took a rest even from themselves took a deep
06:17:50 - 06:17:53
breath and felt revived.
06:17:53 - 06:17:57
I see nobody who ventured a critique of moral valuations.
06:17:57 - 06:18:03
I miss even the slightest attempts of scientific curiosity, of the refined experimental imagination
06:18:03 - 06:18:09
of psychologists and historians that readily anticipates a problem and catches it in flight
06:18:09 - 06:18:12
without quite knowing what it has caught.
06:18:12 - 06:18:17
I have scarcely detected a few meager preliminary efforts to explore the history of the origins
06:18:17 - 06:18:21
of these feelings and valuations, which is something quite different from a critique
06:18:21 - 06:18:25
and again different from a history of ethical systems.
06:18:25 - 06:18:29
In one particular case, I have done everything to encourage a sympathy and talent for this
06:18:29 - 06:18:34
kind of history, in vain, as it seems to me today.
06:18:34 - 06:18:40
These historians of morality, mostly Englishmen, do not amount to much.
06:18:40 - 06:18:46
Usually they themselves are still quite unsuspectingly obedient to one particular morality and,
06:18:46 - 06:18:51
without knowing it, serve that as shield-bearers and followers, for example by sharing that
06:18:51 - 06:18:55
popular superstition of Christian Europe, which people keep mouthing so guilelessly
06:18:55 - 06:19:02
to this day, that what is characteristic of moral actions is selflessness, self-sacrifice,
06:19:02 - 06:19:05
or sympathy and pity.
06:19:05 - 06:19:09
Their usual mistaken premise is that they affirm some consensus of the nations, at least
06:19:09 - 06:19:14
of tame nations, concerning certain principles of morals, and then they infer from this that
06:19:14 - 06:19:19
these principles must be unconditionally binding also for you and me.
06:19:19 - 06:19:25
Or conversely, they see the truth that among different nations, moral valuations are necessarily
06:19:25 - 06:19:30
different and then infer from this that no morality is at all binding.
06:19:30 - 06:19:33
Both procedures are equally childish.
06:19:33 - 06:19:38
The mistake made by the more refined among them is that they uncover and criticize the
06:19:38 - 06:19:43
perhaps foolish opinions of a people about their morality or of humanity about all human
06:19:43 - 06:19:45
morality.
06:19:45 - 06:19:50
Opinions about its origin, religious sanction, the superstition of free will, and things
06:19:50 - 06:19:56
of that sort, and then suppose that they have criticized the morality itself.
06:19:56 - 06:20:01
But the value of a command, thou shalt, is still fundamentally different from and independent
06:20:01 - 06:20:07
of such opinions about it and the weeds of error that may have overgrown it, just as
06:20:07 - 06:20:11
certainly as the value of a medication for a sick person is completely independent of
06:20:11 - 06:20:16
whether he thinks about medicine scientifically or the way old women do.
06:20:16 - 06:20:21
Even if a morality has grown out of an error, the realization of this fact would not as
06:20:21 - 06:20:23
much as touch the problem of its value.
06:20:23 - 06:20:28
Thus nobody up to now has examined the value of that most famous of all medicines which
06:20:28 - 06:20:34
is called morality, and the first step would be for once to question it.
06:20:34 - 06:20:38
Well then, precisely this is our task.
06:20:38 - 06:20:40
346.
06:20:40 - 06:20:42
Our question mark.
06:20:42 - 06:20:44
But you do not understand this.
06:20:44 - 06:20:48
Indeed, people will have trouble understanding us.
06:20:48 - 06:20:52
We are looking for words, perhaps we are also looking for ears.
06:20:52 - 06:20:53
Who are we anyway?
06:20:53 - 06:21:00
If we simply called ourselves, using an old expression, godless or unbelievers or perhaps
06:21:00 - 06:21:05
immoralists, we do not believe that this would even come close to designating us.
06:21:05 - 06:21:11
We are all three in such an advanced stage that one, that you, my curious friends, could
06:21:11 - 06:21:15
never comprehend how we feel at this point.
06:21:15 - 06:21:19
Ours is no longer the bitterness and passion of the person who has torn himself away and
06:21:19 - 06:21:26
still feels compelled to turn his unbelief into a new belief, a purpose, a martyrdom.
06:21:26 - 06:21:31
We have become cold, hard and tough in the realization that the way of this world is
06:21:31 - 06:21:33
anything but divine.
06:21:33 - 06:21:39
Even by human standards it is not rational, merciful or just.
06:21:39 - 06:21:40
We know it well.
06:21:40 - 06:21:45
The world in which we live is ungodly, immoral, inhuman.
06:21:45 - 06:21:50
We have interpreted it far too long in a false and mendacious way, in accordance with the
06:21:50 - 06:21:54
wishes of our reverence, which is to say, according to our needs.
06:21:54 - 06:21:57
For man is a reverent animal.
06:21:57 - 06:22:02
But he is also mistrustful, and that the world is not worth what we thought it was, that
06:22:02 - 06:22:07
is about as certain as anything of which our mistrust has finally got hold.
06:22:07 - 06:22:10
The more mistrust, the more philosophy.
06:22:10 - 06:22:13
We are far from claiming that the world is worth less.
06:22:13 - 06:22:18
Indeed it would seem laughable to us today if man were to insist on inventing values
06:22:18 - 06:22:22
that were supposed to excel the value of the actual world.
06:22:22 - 06:22:27
This is precisely what we have turned our backs on as an extravagant aberration of human
06:22:27 - 06:22:32
vanity and unreason, that for a long time was not recognized as such.
06:22:32 - 06:22:38
It found its final expression in modern pessimism, and a more ancient and stronger expression
06:22:38 - 06:22:40
in the teaching of Buddha.
06:22:40 - 06:22:45
But it is part of Christianity also, if more doubtfully and ambiguously so, but not for
06:22:45 - 06:22:48
that reason any less seductive.
06:22:48 - 06:22:54
The whole pose of man against the world, of man as a world-negating principle, of man
06:22:54 - 06:22:59
as the measure of the value of things, as judge of the world who in the end places existence
06:22:59 - 06:23:04
itself upon his scales and finds it wanting, the monstrous insipidity of this pose has
06:23:04 - 06:23:08
finally come home to us, and we are sick of it.
06:23:08 - 06:23:13
We laugh as soon as we encounter the juxtaposition of man and world, separated by the sublime
06:23:13 - 06:23:16
presumption of the little word and.
06:23:16 - 06:23:20
But look, when we laugh like that, have we not simply carried the contempt for man one
06:23:20 - 06:23:26
step further, and thus also pessimism, the contempt for that existence which is knowable
06:23:26 - 06:23:28
by us?
06:23:28 - 06:23:33
Have we not exposed ourselves to the suspicion of an opposition, an opposition between the
06:23:33 - 06:23:37
world in which we were at home up to now with our reverences that perhaps made it possible
06:23:37 - 06:23:43
for us to endure life, and another world that consists of us, an inexorable, fundamental
06:23:43 - 06:23:49
and deepest suspicion about ourselves that is more and more gaining worse and worse control
06:23:49 - 06:23:55
of us Europeans, and that could easily confront coming generations with the terrifying either-or,
06:23:55 - 06:23:59
either abolish your reverences or yourselves?
06:23:59 - 06:24:03
The latter would be nihilism, but would not the former also be nihilism?
06:24:03 - 06:24:06
This is our question mark.
06:24:06 - 06:24:12
347 Believers and their need to believe.
06:24:12 - 06:24:17
How much one needs a faith in order to flourish, how much that is firm, and that one does not
06:24:17 - 06:24:22
wish to be shaken because one clings to it, that is a measure of the degree of one's strength,
06:24:22 - 06:24:26
or to put the point more clearly, of one's weakness.
06:24:26 - 06:24:32
Christianity, it seems to me, is still needed by most people in old Europe even today, therefore
06:24:32 - 06:24:34
it still finds believers.
06:24:34 - 06:24:37
For this is how man is.
06:24:37 - 06:24:40
An article of faith could be refuted before him a thousand times.
06:24:40 - 06:24:46
If he needed it, he would consider it true again and again, in accordance with that famous
06:24:46 - 06:24:49
proof of strength of which the Bible speaks.
06:24:49 - 06:24:55
Metaphysics is still needed by some, but so is that impetuous demand for certainty that
06:24:55 - 06:25:02
today discharges itself among large numbers of people in a scientific positivistic form.
06:25:02 - 06:25:06
The demand that one wants by all means that something should be firm, while on account
06:25:06 - 06:25:11
of the ardor of this demand one is easier and more negligent about the demonstration
06:25:11 - 06:25:17
of this certainty, this too is still the demand for a support, a prop, in short that
06:25:17 - 06:25:22
instinct of weakness which, to be sure, does not create religious, metaphysical systems
06:25:22 - 06:25:27
and convictions of all kinds, but conserves them.
06:25:27 - 06:25:32
Actually, what is steaming around all of these positivistic systems is the vapor of a certain
06:25:32 - 06:25:38
pessimistic gloom, something that smells of weariness, fatalism, disappointment, and fear
06:25:38 - 06:25:46
of new disappointments, or else ostentatious wrath, a bad mood, the anarchism of indignation,
06:25:46 - 06:25:51
and whatever other symptoms and masquerades of the feeling of weakness there may be.
06:25:51 - 06:25:56
Even the vehemence with which our most intelligent contemporaries lose themselves in wretched
06:25:56 - 06:26:02
nooks and crannies, for example, into patriotism, I mean what the French call chauvinisme and
06:26:02 - 06:26:08
the Germans German, or into petty aesthetic creeds, after the manner of French naturalism,
06:26:08 - 06:26:13
which drags up and bears only that part of nature which inspires nausea and simultaneous
06:26:13 - 06:26:20
amazement, today people like to call this part la vérité vraie, or into nihilism à
06:26:20 - 06:26:27
la Petersburg, meaning the belief in unbelief even to the point of martyrdom, always manifests
06:26:27 - 06:26:33
above all the need for a faith, a support, backbone, something to fall back on.
06:26:33 - 06:26:38
Faith is always coveted most and needed most urgently where will is lacking.
06:26:38 - 06:26:44
For will, as the affect of command, is the decisive sign of sovereignty and strength.
06:26:44 - 06:26:49
In other words, the less one knows how to command, the more urgently one covets someone
06:26:49 - 06:26:57
who commands, who commands severely, a god, prince, class, physician, father confessor,
06:26:57 - 06:27:00
dogma, or party conscience.
06:27:00 - 06:27:05
From this one might perhaps gather that the two world religions, Buddhism and Christianity,
06:27:05 - 06:27:10
may have owed their origin, and above all, their sudden spread to a tremendous collapse
06:27:10 - 06:27:15
and disease of the will, and that is what actually happened.
06:27:15 - 06:27:20
Both religions encountered a situation in which the will had become diseased, giving
06:27:20 - 06:27:25
rise to a demand that had become utterly desperate for some thou shalt.
06:27:25 - 06:27:31
Both religions taught fanaticism in ages in which the will had become exhausted, and
06:27:31 - 06:27:36
thus they offered innumerable people some support, a new possibility of willing, some
06:27:36 - 06:27:38
delight in willing.
06:27:38 - 06:27:43
For fanaticism is the only strength of the will that even the weak and insecure can be
06:27:43 - 06:27:48
brought to attain, being a sort of hypnotism of the whole system of the senses and the
06:27:48 - 06:27:54
intellect, for the benefit of an excessive nourishment, hypertrophy, of a single point
06:27:54 - 06:28:00
of view and feeling that henceforth becomes dominant, which the Christian calls his faith.
06:28:00 - 06:28:06
Once a human being reaches the fundamental conviction that he must be commanded, he becomes
06:28:06 - 06:28:07
a believer.
06:28:07 - 06:28:13
Conversely, one could conceive of such a pleasure and power of self-determination, such a freedom
06:28:13 - 06:28:18
of the will that the spirit would take leave of all faith and every wish for certainty,
06:28:18 - 06:28:23
being practiced in maintaining himself on insubstantial ropes and possibilities, and
06:28:23 - 06:28:25
dancing even near abysses.
06:28:25 - 06:28:30
Such a spirit would be the free spirit par excellence.
06:28:30 - 06:28:37
348 On the Origin of Scholars
06:28:37 - 06:28:42
In Europe scholars grow out of all kinds of classes and social conditions, like plants
06:28:42 - 06:28:45
that require no particular soil.
06:28:45 - 06:28:49
Therefore they belong by their very nature, and quite involuntarily, to the carriers of
06:28:49 - 06:28:51
the democratic idea.
06:28:51 - 06:28:54
But this origin betrays itself.
06:28:54 - 06:28:59
Once one has trained one's eyes to recognize in a scholarly treatise the scholar's intellectual
06:28:59 - 06:29:06
idiosyncrasy, every scholar has one, and to catch it in the act, one will almost always
06:29:06 - 06:29:08
behold.
06:29:08 - 06:29:12
Behind this the scholar's prehistory, his family, and especially their occupations and
06:29:12 - 06:29:14
crafts.
06:29:14 - 06:29:19
Where the feeling finds expression, now this has been proved and I am done with it, it
06:29:19 - 06:29:23
is generally the ancestor in the blood and instinct of the scholar who approves from
06:29:23 - 06:29:26
his point of view the finished job.
06:29:26 - 06:29:31
The faith in a proof is merely a symptom of what in a hardworking family has for ages
06:29:31 - 06:29:34
been considered good workmanship.
06:29:34 - 06:29:35
One example.
06:29:35 - 06:29:40
When the sons of clerks and office workers of every kind, whose main task it has always
06:29:40 - 06:29:45
been to bring order into diverse materials, to distribute it over different files, and
06:29:45 - 06:29:51
in general to schematize things, become scholars, they manifest a tendency to consider a problem
06:29:51 - 06:29:55
almost as solved when they have merely schematized it.
06:29:55 - 06:29:59
There are philosophers who are fundamentally merely schematizers.
06:29:59 - 06:30:04
For them, the formal aspect of their father's occupation has become content.
06:30:04 - 06:30:10
The talent for classifications for tables of categories betrays something.
06:30:10 - 06:30:13
One pays a price for being the child of one's parents.
06:30:13 - 06:30:18
The son of an advocate will have to be an advocate as a scholar, too.
06:30:18 - 06:30:23
He wants above all that his cause should be judged right, and next to that, perhaps also,
06:30:23 - 06:30:25
that it should be right.
06:30:25 - 06:30:31
The sons of Protestant ministers and schoolteachers may be recognized by their naive certainty
06:30:31 - 06:30:36
when, as scholars, they consider their cause proved when they have merely stated it with
06:30:36 - 06:30:38
vigor and warmth.
06:30:38 - 06:30:43
They are thoroughly used to being believed, as that was part of their father's job.
06:30:43 - 06:30:49
A Jew, on the other hand, in keeping with the business circles and the past of his people,
06:30:49 - 06:30:52
is least of all used to being believed.
06:30:52 - 06:30:54
Consider Jewish scholars in this light.
06:30:54 - 06:30:59
All of them have a high regard for logic, that is, for compelling agreement by force
06:30:59 - 06:31:00
of reasons.
06:31:00 - 06:31:06
They know, with that they are bound to win even where they encounter race and class prejudices
06:31:06 - 06:31:08
and where one does not like to believe them.
06:31:08 - 06:31:11
For nothing is more democratic than logic.
06:31:11 - 06:31:17
It is no respecter of persons and makes no distinction between crooked and straight noses.
06:31:17 - 06:31:22
Incidentally, Europeos the Jews know small thanks for making people think more logically
06:31:22 - 06:31:25
and for establishing cleanlier intellectual habits.
06:31:25 - 06:31:29
Nobody more so than the Germans, who are a lamentably derasonable race, who to this day
06:31:29 - 06:31:33
are still in need of having their heads washed first.
06:31:33 - 06:31:38
Wherever Jews have won influence, they have taught men to make finer distinctions, more
06:31:38 - 06:31:42
rigorous inferences, and to write in a more luminous and cleanly fashion.
06:31:42 - 06:31:47
Their task was ever to bring a people to listen to raison.
06:31:47 - 06:31:50
349
06:31:50 - 06:31:53
Once more the origin of scholars.
06:31:53 - 06:31:58
The wish to preserve oneself is the symptom of a condition of distress, of a limitation
06:31:58 - 06:32:03
of the really fundamental instinct of life which aims at the expansion of power and wishing
06:32:03 - 06:32:08
for that frequently risks and even sacrifices self-preservation.
06:32:08 - 06:32:13
It should be considered symptomatic when some philosophers, for example Spinoza who was
06:32:13 - 06:32:19
consumptive, considered the instinct of self-preservation decisive and had to see it that way, for they
06:32:19 - 06:32:22
were individuals in conditions of distress.
06:32:22 - 06:32:27
That our modern natural sciences have become so thoroughly entangled in this Spinozistic
06:32:27 - 06:32:34
dogma, most recently and worst of all, Darwinism, with its incomprehensibly one-sided doctrine
06:32:34 - 06:32:40
of the struggle for existence, is probably due to the origins of most natural scientists.
06:32:40 - 06:32:43
In this respect they belong to the common people.
06:32:43 - 06:32:47
Their ancestors were poor and undistinguished people who knew the difficulties of survival
06:32:47 - 06:32:49
only too well at first hand.
06:32:49 - 06:32:54
The whole of English Darwinism breathes something like the mustier of English overpopulation,
06:32:54 - 06:32:58
like the smell of the distress and overcrowding of small people.
06:32:58 - 06:32:59
But a natural scientist should
06:32:59 - 06:33:04
come out of his human nook, and in nature it is not conditions of distress that are
06:33:04 - 06:33:09
dominant, but overflow and squandering, even to the point of absurdity.
06:33:09 - 06:33:16
The struggle for existence is only an exception, a temporary restriction of the will to life.
06:33:16 - 06:33:22
The great and small struggle always revolves around superiority, around growth and expansion,
06:33:22 - 06:33:29
around power, in accordance with the will to power, which is the will of life.
06:33:29 - 06:33:35
350 In honor of the homines religiosi, the fight
06:33:35 - 06:33:39
against the Church is certainly among other things, for it means many things, also the
06:33:39 - 06:33:46
fight of the more common, merrier, more familiar, ingenuous and superficial type, against the
06:33:46 - 06:33:52
dominion of the graver, deeper, more meditative, that is, more evil and suspicious human beings
06:33:52 - 06:33:57
who brood with an enduring suspicion about the value of existence and also about their
06:33:57 - 06:33:59
own value.
06:33:59 - 06:34:05
The common instinct of the people, their sensuous jollity, their good heart, rebelled against
06:34:05 - 06:34:06
them.
06:34:06 - 06:34:10
The entire Roman Church rests upon a Southern suspicion about the nature of man, and this
06:34:10 - 06:34:13
is always misunderstood in the North.
06:34:13 - 06:34:18
The European South has inherited this suspicion from the depths of the Orient, from primeval
06:34:18 - 06:34:21
and mysterious Asia, and its contemplation.
06:34:21 - 06:34:26
Protestantism already is a people's rebellion for the benefit of the ingenuous, guileless
06:34:26 - 06:34:31
and superficial, the North has always been more good-natured and shallower than the South.
06:34:31 - 06:34:35
But it was only the French Revolution that actually and solemnly placed the scepter in
06:34:35 - 06:34:41
the hands of the good human being, the sheep, the ass, the goose, and all who are incurably
06:34:41 - 06:34:47
shallow squallers, ripe for the nuthouse of modern ideas.
06:34:47 - 06:34:54
351 In honor of the priestly type.
06:34:54 - 06:34:58
I rather think that it is precisely from what the common people take for wisdom, and who
06:34:58 - 06:35:04
today is not common people, this clever bovine piety, peace of mind, and meekness of country
06:35:04 - 06:35:10
pastors that lies in the meadow and observes life seriously while ruminating, that the
06:35:10 - 06:35:15
philosophers have always felt most remote, probably because they were not sufficiently
06:35:15 - 06:35:20
common people or country pastors for that.
06:35:20 - 06:35:24
It is likely that they of all people will be the last to learn to believe that the common
06:35:24 - 06:35:30
people could possibly understand anything of what is most remote from them, the great
06:35:30 - 06:35:36
passion of the seeker after knowledge who lives and must live continually in the thundercloud
06:35:36 - 06:35:44
of the highest problems and the heaviest responsibilities, by no means as an observer, outside, indifferent,
06:35:44 - 06:35:47
secure, and objective.
06:35:47 - 06:35:51
The common people revere an altogether different human type when they construct their ideal
06:35:51 - 06:35:57
of the sage, and they are amply entitled to lavish the best words and honors on this type,
06:35:57 - 06:36:03
namely the mild, serious, and simple-minded chaste priestly type, and what is related
06:36:03 - 06:36:04
to it.
06:36:04 - 06:36:10
When the common people stand in awe of wisdom, their praise is intended for this type, and
06:36:10 - 06:36:14
to whom would the common people have more reason to show gratitude than these men who
06:36:14 - 06:36:17
belong to them and come from among them?
06:36:17 - 06:36:22
But as men who are consecrated, selected, and sacrificed for the welfare of the common
06:36:22 - 06:36:27
people, they themselves believe that they are being sacrificed to God.
06:36:27 - 06:36:31
It is to these men that the common people can spill their hearts with impunity.
06:36:31 - 06:36:36
To them one can get rid of one's secrets, worries, and worse matters, for as a human
06:36:36 - 06:36:43
being communicates himself, he gets rid of himself, and when one has confessed, one forgets.
06:36:43 - 06:36:48
It is a deep need that commands this, for the filth of the soul also requires sewers
06:36:48 - 06:36:51
with pure and purifying waters in them.
06:36:51 - 06:36:56
It requires rapid streams of love and strong, humble, pure hearts who are willing to perform
06:36:56 - 06:37:01
such a service of non-public hygiene, sacrificing themselves.
06:37:01 - 06:37:07
For this does involve a sacrifice, and a priest is and remains a human sacrifice.
06:37:07 - 06:37:13
The common people attribute wisdom to such serious men of faith who have become quiet,
06:37:13 - 06:37:19
meaning that they have acquired knowledge and are certain compared to one's own uncertainty.
06:37:19 - 06:37:23
Who would want to deny them this word and this reverence?
06:37:23 - 06:37:29
But it is also fair, conversely, when philosophers consider priests as still common people and
06:37:29 - 06:37:35
not men of knowledge, above all because they simply do not believe in any men of knowledge.
06:37:35 - 06:37:41
In this belief, or rather superstition, they smell the common people.
06:37:41 - 06:37:47
It was modesty that invented the word philosopher in Greece and left the magnificent overweening
06:37:47 - 06:37:53
presumption in calling oneself wise to the actors of the spirit, the modesty of such
06:37:53 - 06:37:59
monsters of pride and sovereignty as Pythagoras, as Plato.
06:37:59 - 06:38:05
352 How Morality is Scarcely Dispensable
06:38:05 - 06:38:08
A naked human being is generally a shameful sight.
06:38:08 - 06:38:13
I am speaking of us Europeans, and not even of female Europeans.
06:38:13 - 06:38:18
Suppose that, owing to some magician's malice, the most cheerful company at table suddenly
06:38:18 - 06:38:21
saw itself disrobed and undressed.
06:38:21 - 06:38:25
I believe that not only their cheerfulness would vanish, and that the strongest appetite
06:38:25 - 06:38:27
would be discouraged.
06:38:27 - 06:38:33
It seems that we Europeans simply cannot dispense with that masquerade, which one calls clothes.
06:38:33 - 06:38:38
Now consider the way moral man is dressed up, how he is veiled behind moral formulas
06:38:38 - 06:38:43
and concepts of decency, the way our actions are benevolently concealed by the concepts
06:38:43 - 06:38:50
of duty, virtue, sense of community, honorableness, self-denial.
06:38:50 - 06:38:54
Should the reasons for all this not be equally good, I am not suggesting that all this is
06:38:54 - 06:38:59
meant to mask human malice and villainy, the wild animal in us.
06:38:59 - 06:39:05
My idea is, on the contrary, that it is precisely as tame animals that we are a shameful sight
06:39:05 - 06:39:10
and in need of the moral disguise, that the inner man in Europe is not by a long shot
06:39:10 - 06:39:15
bad enough to show himself without shame, or to be beautiful.
06:39:15 - 06:39:20
The European disguises himself with morality because he has become a sick, sickly, crippled
06:39:20 - 06:39:26
animal that has good reasons for being tame, for he is almost an abortion, scarce half
06:39:26 - 06:39:28
made up, weak, awkward.
06:39:28 - 06:39:34
It is not the ferocity of the beast of prey that requires a moral disguise, but the herd
06:39:34 - 06:39:39
animal with its profound mediocrity, timidity and boredom with itself.
06:39:39 - 06:39:46
With morality the European dresses up, let us confess it, to look nobler, more important,
06:39:46 - 06:39:49
more respectable, divine.
06:39:49 - 06:39:55
353 On the Origin of Religions
06:39:55 - 06:40:01
The distinctive invention of the founders of religions is, first, to posit a particular
06:40:01 - 06:40:06
kind of life and everyday customs that have the effect of a disciplina voluntatis and
06:40:06 - 06:40:13
at the same time abolish boredom and then, to bestow on this life, style and interpretation,
06:40:13 - 06:40:18
that makes it appear to be, eliminated by the highest value so, that this lifestyle
06:40:18 - 06:40:23
becomes something for which one fights and under certain circumstances sacrifices one's
06:40:23 - 06:40:24
life.
06:40:24 - 06:40:28
Actually, the second of these two inventions is more essential.
06:40:28 - 06:40:34
The first, the way of life, was usually there before, but alongside other ways of life and
06:40:34 - 06:40:36
without any sense of its special value.
06:40:36 - 06:40:42
The significance and originality of the founder of a religion usually consists of his seeing
06:40:42 - 06:40:47
it, selecting it, and guessing for the first time to what use it can be put, how it can
06:40:47 - 06:40:49
be interpreted.
06:40:49 - 06:40:56
Jesus, or Paul, for example, found how small people lived in the Roman province, a modest,
06:40:56 - 06:40:59
virtuous, pinched life.
06:40:59 - 06:41:04
He offered an exegesis, he read the highest meaning and value into it, and with this also
06:41:04 - 06:41:10
the courage to despise every other way of life, the quiet, herrnhut fanaticism, the
06:41:10 - 06:41:15
secret, subterranean self-confidence that grows and grows and finally is ready to overcome
06:41:15 - 06:41:21
the world, that is, Rome and the upper classes throughout the empire.
06:41:21 - 06:41:25
Buddha likewise found a human type, in his case, scattered through all classes and social
06:41:25 - 06:41:32
strata of his people, that was good and good-natured from inertia and above all inoffensive.
06:41:32 - 06:41:37
Also from inertia, this type lived abstinently, almost without needs.
06:41:37 - 06:41:42
He understood how such a human type must inevitably roll, with its whole vis inertiae, into a
06:41:42 - 06:41:48
faith that promises to prevent the recurrence of terrestrial troubles, meaning work and
06:41:48 - 06:41:50
action in general.
06:41:50 - 06:41:52
To understand that was his genius.
06:41:52 - 06:41:57
To become the founder of a religion one must be psychologically infallible in one's knowledge
06:41:57 - 06:42:03
of a certain average type of souls who have not yet recognized that they belong together.
06:42:03 - 06:42:06
It is he that brings them together.
06:42:06 - 06:42:12
The founding of a religion therefore always becomes a long festival of recognition.
06:42:12 - 06:42:16
354
06:42:16 - 06:42:19
On the Genius of the Species
06:42:19 - 06:42:24
The problem of consciousness, more precisely of becoming conscious of something, confronts
06:42:24 - 06:42:28
us only when we begin to comprehend how we could dispense with it.
06:42:28 - 06:42:34
And now physiology and the history of animals place use at the beginning of such comprehension.
06:42:34 - 06:42:40
It took them two centuries to catch up with Leibniz's suspicion, which soared ahead.
06:42:40 - 06:42:44
For we could think, feel, will and remember.
06:42:44 - 06:42:49
And we could also act, in every sense of that word.
06:42:49 - 06:42:54
And yet none of all this would have to enter our consciousness, as one says metaphorically.
06:42:54 - 06:43:00
The whole of life would be possible without, as it were, seeing itself in a mirror.
06:43:00 - 06:43:05
Even now, for that matter, by far the greatest portion of our life actually takes place without
06:43:05 - 06:43:07
this mirror effect.
06:43:07 - 06:43:12
And this is true even of our thinking, feeling and willing life, however offensive this may
06:43:12 - 06:43:15
sound to older philosophers.
06:43:15 - 06:43:21
For what purpose, then, any consciousness at all, when it is in the main superfluous?
06:43:21 - 06:43:26
Now if you are willing to listen to my answer and the perhaps extravagant surmise that it
06:43:26 - 06:43:31
involves, it seems to me as if the subtlety and strength of consciousness always were
06:43:31 - 06:43:37
proportionate to a man's or animal's capacity for communication, and as if this capacity
06:43:37 - 06:43:41
in turn were proportionate to the need for communication.
06:43:41 - 06:43:46
But this last point is not to be understood as if the individual human being who happens
06:43:46 - 06:43:51
to be a master in communicating and making understandable his needs must also be most
06:43:51 - 06:43:54
dependent on others in his needs.
06:43:54 - 06:43:59
But it does seem to me as if it were that way when we consider whole races and chains
06:43:59 - 06:44:01
of generations.
06:44:01 - 06:44:05
Where need and distress have forced men for a long time to communicate and to understand
06:44:05 - 06:44:11
each other quickly and subtly, the ultimate result is an excess of this strength and art
06:44:11 - 06:44:16
of communication, as it were, a capacity that has gradually been accumulated and now
06:44:16 - 06:44:20
waits for an heir who might squander it.
06:44:20 - 06:44:26
Those who are called artists are these heirs, so are orators, preachers, writers, all of
06:44:26 - 06:44:32
them, people who always come at the end of a long chain, late born, every one of them
06:44:32 - 06:44:38
in the best sense of that word and, as I have said, by their nature, squanderers.
06:44:38 - 06:44:42
Assuming that this observation is correct, I may now proceed to the surmise that consciousness
06:44:42 - 06:44:47
has developed only under the pressure of the need for communication, that from the start
06:44:47 - 06:44:53
it was needed and useful only between human beings, particularly between those who commanded
06:44:53 - 06:45:00
and those who obeyed, and that it also developed only in proportion to the degree of this utility.
06:45:00 - 06:45:04
Consciousness is really only a net of communication between human beings.
06:45:04 - 06:45:06
It is only as such that it had to develop.
06:45:06 - 06:45:11
A solitary human being who lived like a beast of prey would not have needed it.
06:45:11 - 06:45:16
That our actions, thoughts, feelings, and movements enter our own consciousness, at
06:45:16 - 06:45:22
least a part of them, that is the result of a must that for a terribly long time lorded
06:45:22 - 06:45:24
it over man.
06:45:24 - 06:45:29
As the most endangered animal, he needed help and protection, he needed his peers, he had
06:45:29 - 06:45:34
to learn to express his distress and to make himself understood.
06:45:34 - 06:45:37
And for all of this he needed consciousness.
06:45:37 - 06:45:42
First of all, he needed to know himself what distressed him, he needed to know how he felt,
06:45:42 - 06:45:45
he needed to know what he thought.
06:45:45 - 06:45:51
For to say it once more, man, like every living being, thinks continually without knowing
06:45:51 - 06:45:52
it.
06:45:52 - 06:45:57
The thinking that rises to consciousness is only the smallest part of all this, the most
06:45:57 - 06:46:03
superficial and worst part, for only this conscious thinking takes the form of words,
06:46:03 - 06:46:09
which is to say signs of communication, and this fact uncovers the origin of consciousness.
06:46:09 - 06:46:15
In brief, the development of language and the development of consciousness, not of reason,
06:46:15 - 06:46:20
but merely of the way reason enters consciousness, go hand in hand.
06:46:20 - 06:46:25
Add to this that not only language serves as a bridge between human beings, but also
06:46:25 - 06:46:28
a mien, a pressure, a gesture.
06:46:28 - 06:46:32
The emergence of our sense impressions into our own consciousness, the ability to fix
06:46:32 - 06:46:38
them and, as it were, exhibit them externally, increased proportionately with the need to
06:46:38 - 06:46:42
communicate them to others by means of signs.
06:46:42 - 06:46:48
The human being inventing signs is at the same time the human being who becomes ever
06:46:48 - 06:46:51
more keenly conscious of himself.
06:46:51 - 06:46:57
It was only as a social animal that man acquired self-consciousness, which he is still in the
06:46:57 - 06:47:00
process of doing, more and more.
06:47:00 - 06:47:05
My idea is, as you see, that consciousness does not really belong to man's individual
06:47:05 - 06:47:10
existence, but rather to his social or herd nature.
06:47:10 - 06:47:15
That as follows from this, it has developed subtlety only insofar as this is required
06:47:15 - 06:47:18
by social or here utility.
06:47:18 - 06:47:23
Consequently, given the best will, in the world to understand ourselves as individually
06:47:23 - 06:47:28
as possible, to know ourselves, each of us will always succeed in becoming conscious
06:47:28 - 06:47:32
only of what is not individual but average.
06:47:32 - 06:47:36
Our thoughts themselves are continually governed by the character of consciousness, by the
06:47:36 - 06:47:41
genius of the species that commands it, and translated back into the perspective of the
06:47:41 - 06:47:42
herd.
06:47:42 - 06:47:48
Fundamentally, all our actions are altogether incomparably personal, unique, and infinitely
06:47:48 - 06:47:49
individual.
06:47:49 - 06:47:51
There is no doubt of that.
06:47:51 - 06:47:56
But as soon as we translate them into consciousness, they no longer seem to be.
06:47:56 - 06:48:00
This is the essence of phenomenalism and perspectivism as I understand them.
06:48:00 - 06:48:05
Owing to the nature of animal consciousness, the world of which we can become conscious
06:48:05 - 06:48:10
is only a surface and sign world, a world that is made common and meaner.
06:48:10 - 06:48:16
Whatever becomes conscious becomes by the same token, shallow, thin, relatively stupid,
06:48:16 - 06:48:18
general sign, herd signal.
06:48:18 - 06:48:24
All becoming conscious involves a great and thorough corruption, falsification, reduction
06:48:24 - 06:48:27
to superficialities, and generalization.
06:48:27 - 06:48:33
Ultimately, the growth of consciousness becomes a danger, and anyone who lives among the most
06:48:33 - 06:48:38
conscious Europeans even knows that it is a disease.
06:48:38 - 06:48:43
You will guess that it is not the opposition of subject and object that concerns me here.
06:48:43 - 06:48:48
This distinction I leave to the epistemologists who have become entangled in the snares of
06:48:48 - 06:48:51
grammar, the metaphysics of the people.
06:48:51 - 06:48:57
It is even less the opposition of thing in itself and appearance, for we do not know
06:48:57 - 06:49:00
nearly enough to be entitled to any such distinction.
06:49:00 - 06:49:04
We simply lack any organ for knowledge, for truth.
06:49:04 - 06:49:10
We know, or believe, or imagine, just as much as may be useful in the interests of the human
06:49:10 - 06:49:13
herd, the species.
06:49:13 - 06:49:20
And even what is here called utility is ultimately also a mere belief, something imaginary, and
06:49:20 - 06:49:27
perhaps precisely that most calamitous stupidity of which we shall perish someday.
06:49:27 - 06:49:32
3.55
06:49:32 - 06:49:35
The Origin of Our Concept of Knowledge
06:49:35 - 06:49:37
I take this explanation from the street.
06:49:37 - 06:49:42
I heard one of the common people say, he knew me right away.
06:49:42 - 06:49:46
Then I ask myself, what is it that the common people take for knowledge?
06:49:46 - 06:49:49
What do they want when they want knowledge?
06:49:49 - 06:49:51
Nothing more than this.
06:49:51 - 06:49:54
Something strange is to be reduced to something familiar.
06:49:54 - 06:50:00
And we philosophers, have we really meant more than this when we have spoken of knowledge?
06:50:00 - 06:50:05
What is familiar means what we are used to so that we no longer marvel at it, our everyday,
06:50:05 - 06:50:10
some rule in which we are stuck, anything at all in which we feel at home.
06:50:10 - 06:50:16
Look, isn't our need for knowledge precisely this need for the familiar, the will to uncover
06:50:16 - 06:50:22
under everything strange, unusual, and questionable something that no longer disturbs us?
06:50:22 - 06:50:25
Is it not the instinct of fear that bids us to know?
06:50:25 - 06:50:30
And is the jubilation of those who attain knowledge not the jubilation over the restoration
06:50:30 - 06:50:32
of a sense of security?
06:50:32 - 06:50:37
Here is a philosopher who fancied that the world was known when he had reduced it to
06:50:37 - 06:50:39
the idea.
06:50:39 - 06:50:44
Was it not because the idea was so familiar to him and he was so well used to it, because
06:50:44 - 06:50:47
he hardly was afraid of the idea anymore?
06:50:47 - 06:50:50
How easily these men of knowledge are satisfied.
06:50:50 - 06:50:55
Just have a look at their principles and their solutions of the world riddled with this in mind.
06:50:55 - 06:51:00
When they find something in things, under them or behind them, that is unfortunately
06:51:00 - 06:51:07
quite familiar to us, such as our multiplication tables or our logic, or our willing and desiring,
06:51:07 - 06:51:09
how happy they are right away.
06:51:09 - 06:51:11
For what is familiar is known.
06:51:11 - 06:51:13
On this they are agreed.
06:51:13 - 06:51:17
Even the most cautious among them suppose that what is familiar is at least more easily
06:51:17 - 06:51:23
knowable than what is strange, and that, for example, sound method demands that we start
06:51:23 - 06:51:30
from the inner world, from the facts of consciousness, because this world is more familiar to us.
06:51:30 - 06:51:32
Error of errors.
06:51:32 - 06:51:38
What is familiar is what we are used to, and what we are used to is most difficult to know,
06:51:38 - 06:51:46
that is, to see as a problem, that is, to see as strange, as distant, as outside us.
06:51:46 - 06:51:50
The great certainty of the natural sciences in comparison with psychology and the critique
06:51:50 - 06:51:56
of the elements of consciousness, one might almost say, with the unnatural sciences, is
06:51:56 - 06:52:01
due precisely to the fact that they choose for their object what is strange, while it
06:52:01 - 06:52:07
is almost contradictory and absurd to even try to choose for an object what is not strange.
06:52:07 - 06:52:10
356.
06:52:10 - 06:52:14
How things will become ever more artistic in Europe.
06:52:14 - 06:52:19
Even today, in our time of transition when so many factors cease to compel men, the care
06:52:19 - 06:52:24
to make a living still compels almost all male Europeans to adopt a particular role,
06:52:24 - 06:52:27
their so-called occupation.
06:52:27 - 06:52:33
A few retain the freedom, a merely apparent freedom, to choose this role for themselves.
06:52:33 - 06:52:35
For most men it is chosen.
06:52:35 - 06:52:37
The result is rather strange.
06:52:37 - 06:52:43
As they attain a more advanced age, almost all Europeans confound themselves with their
06:52:43 - 06:52:44
role.
06:52:44 - 06:52:47
They become the victims of their own good performance.
06:52:47 - 06:52:52
They themselves have forgotten how much accidents, moods, and caprice disposed of them when the
06:52:52 - 06:52:58
question of their vocation was decided, and how many other roles they might perhaps have
06:52:58 - 06:52:59
been able to play.
06:52:59 - 06:53:02
For now it is too late.
06:53:02 - 06:53:08
Considered more deeply, the role has actually become character, and art, nature.
06:53:08 - 06:53:13
There have been ages when men believed with rigid confidence, even with piety, in their
06:53:13 - 06:53:20
predestination for precisely this occupation, precisely this way of earning a living, and
06:53:20 - 06:53:25
simply refused to acknowledge the element of accident, role, and caprice.
06:53:25 - 06:53:31
With the help of this faith, classes, guilds, and hereditary trade privileges, managed to
06:53:31 - 06:53:36
erect those monsters of social pyramids that distinguish the Middle Ages, and to whose
06:53:36 - 06:53:42
credit one can adduce at least one thing, durability, and duration is a first-rate value
06:53:42 - 06:53:43
on earth.
06:53:43 - 06:53:49
But there are opposite ages, really democratic, where people give up this faith, and a certain
06:53:49 - 06:53:54
cocky faith and opposite point of view advance more and more into the foreground.
06:53:54 - 06:54:00
The Athenian faith that first becomes noticeable in the Periclean age, the faith of the Americans
06:54:00 - 06:54:04
today that is more and more becoming the European faith as well.
06:54:04 - 06:54:09
The individual becomes convinced that he can do just about everything, and can manage almost
06:54:09 - 06:54:16
any role, and everybody experiments with himself, improvises, makes new experiments, enjoys
06:54:16 - 06:54:21
his experiments, and all nature ceases and becomes art.
06:54:21 - 06:54:26
After accepting this role-faith, an artist's faith, if you will, the Greeks, as is well
06:54:26 - 06:54:32
known, went step for step through a rather odd metamorphosis that does not merit imitation
06:54:32 - 06:54:33
in all respects.
06:54:33 - 06:54:36
They really became actors.
06:54:36 - 06:54:41
As such, they enchanted and overcame all the world, and finally even, the power that had
06:54:41 - 06:54:46
overcome the world, for the Greekulus Histrio vanquished Rome, and not, as innocents usually
06:54:46 - 06:54:48
say, Greek culture.
06:54:48 - 06:54:49
But what I fear?
06:54:49 - 06:54:55
What is so palpable that today one could grasp it with one's hands, if one felt like grasping it,
06:54:55 - 06:54:59
is that we modern men are even now pretty far along on the same road.
06:55:00 - 06:55:05
And whenever a human being begins to discover how he is playing a role and how he can be an actor,
06:55:06 - 06:55:12
he becomes an actor. With this, a new human flora and fauna emerge that could never have
06:55:12 - 06:55:17
grown in more solid and limited ages, or at least they would be left there below,
06:55:17 - 06:55:22
under the ban and suspicion of lacking honor. It is thus that the maddest and most interesting
06:55:22 - 06:55:29
ages of history always emerge, when the actors, all kinds of actors, become the real masters.
06:55:29 - 06:55:35
As this happens, another human type is disadvantaged more and more, and finally
06:55:35 - 06:55:42
made impossible. Above all, the great architects. The strength to build becomes paralyzed.
06:55:42 - 06:55:47
The courage to make plans that encompass the distant future is discouraged. Those with a
06:55:47 - 06:55:52
genius for organization become scarce. Who would still dare to undertake projects that would
06:55:52 - 06:55:58
require thousands of years for their completion? For what is dying out is the fundamental faith
06:55:58 - 06:56:04
that would enable us to calculate, to promise, to anticipate the future in plans of such scope,
06:56:04 - 06:56:10
and to sacrifice the future to them, namely, the faith that man has value and meaning
06:56:10 - 06:56:16
only insofar as he is a stone in a great edifice, and to that end, he must be solid,
06:56:16 - 06:56:24
first of all, a stone, and above all, not an actor. To say it briefly, for a long time people
06:56:24 - 06:56:29
will still keep silent about it. What will not be built anymore henceforth, and cannot be built
06:56:29 - 06:56:36
anymore, is a society in the old sense of that word. To build that, everything is lacking, above
06:56:36 - 06:56:42
all, the material. All of us are no longer material for a society. This is a truth for which
06:56:42 - 06:56:48
the time has come. It is a matter of indifference to me that at present the most myopic, perhaps
06:56:48 - 06:56:54
most honest, but at any rate noisiest human type that we have today, our good socialists, believe,
06:56:54 - 06:57:01
hope, dream, and above all, shout and write almost the opposite. Even now one reads their
06:57:01 - 06:57:10
slogan for the future free society on all tables and walls. Free society? Yes, yes. But surely you
06:57:10 - 06:57:15
know, gentlemen, what is required for building that? Wooden iron, the well-known wooden iron,
06:57:15 - 06:57:19
and it must not even be wooden. 357
06:57:22 - 06:57:28
On the old problem, what is German? Recapitulate in your mind the real achievements of philosophical
06:57:28 - 06:57:33
thinking that one owes to Germans. Is there any legitimate sense in which one might give the
06:57:33 - 06:57:39
credit for these achievements to the whole race? May we say that they are at the same time the
06:57:39 - 06:57:46
product of the German soul, or at least symptoms of that in the sense in which, say, Plato's
06:57:46 - 06:57:52
Ideomania, his almost religious madness about forms, is usually taken also for an event and
06:57:52 - 06:57:59
testimony of the Greek soul? Or should the opposite be the truth? Might they be just as
06:57:59 - 06:58:06
individual, just as much exceptions from the spirit of the race, as was, for example, Goethe's paganism
06:58:06 - 06:58:12
with a good conscience, or as is Bismarck's Machiavellism with a good conscience, his so-called
06:58:12 - 06:58:19
Realpolitik among Germans? Might our philosophers actually contradict the need of the German soul?
06:58:20 - 06:58:27
In short, were the German philosophers really philosophical Germans? I recall three cases.
06:58:28 - 06:58:34
First, Leibniz's incomparable insight that has been vindicated not only against Descartes,
06:58:34 - 06:58:39
but against everybody who had philosophized before him, that consciousness is merely an
06:58:39 - 06:58:45
accident of experience and not its necessary and essential attribute. That, in other words,
06:58:46 - 06:58:51
what we call consciousness constitutes only one state of our spiritual and psychic world,
06:58:51 - 06:58:58
perhaps a pathological state, and not by any means the whole of it. The profundity of this idea has
06:58:58 - 06:59:04
not been exhausted to this day. Is there anything German in this idea? Is there any reason for
06:59:04 - 06:59:09
surmising that no Latin could easily have thought of this reversal of appearances? For it is a
06:59:09 - 06:59:15
reversal. Let us recall, secondly, Kant's tremendous question mark that he placed after
06:59:15 - 06:59:21
the concept of causality, without, like Hume, doubting its legitimacy altogether. Rather,
06:59:21 - 06:59:27
Kant began cautiously to delimit the realm within which this concept makes sense, and to this day
06:59:27 - 06:59:34
we are not done with this fixing of limits. Let us take, thirdly, the astonishing stroke of Hegel,
06:59:34 - 06:59:39
who struck right through all our logical habits and bad habits when he dared to teach that species
06:59:39 - 06:59:44
concepts develop out of each other. With this proposition, the minds of Europe were preformed
06:59:44 - 06:59:50
for the last great scientific movement, Darwinism. For without Hegel, there could have been no Darwin.
06:59:52 - 06:59:56
Is there anything German in this Hegelian innovation which first introduced the
06:59:56 - 07:00:02
decisive concept of development into science? Yes, without any doubt. In all three cases,
07:00:02 - 07:00:08
we feel that something in ourselves has been uncovered and guessed, and we are grateful for
07:00:08 - 07:00:14
it and at the same time surprised. Each of these three propositions is a thoughtful piece of German
07:00:14 - 07:00:21
self-knowledge, self-experience, self-understanding. Our inner world is much richer, more comprehensive,
07:00:21 - 07:00:27
more concealed, we feel with Leibniz. As Germans, we doubt with Kant the ultimate validity of the
07:00:27 - 07:00:32
knowledge attained by the natural sciences and altogether everything that can be known.
07:00:32 - 07:00:38
Causaliter. Whatever is knowable immediately seems to us less valuable on that account.
07:00:39 - 07:00:45
We Germans are Hegelians even if there never had been any Hegel, insofar as we, unlike all Latins,
07:00:46 - 07:00:51
instinctively attribute a deeper meaning and greater value to becoming and development
07:00:51 - 07:00:56
than to what is. We hardly believe in the justification of the concept of being,
07:00:56 - 07:01:02
and also, insofar as we are not inclined to concede that our human logic is logic as such
07:01:02 - 07:01:07
or the only kind of logic, we would rather persuade ourselves that it is merely a special case
07:01:07 - 07:01:12
and perhaps one of the oddest and most stupid cases. It would be a fourth question whether
07:01:12 - 07:01:17
Schopenhauer too, with his pessimism, that is the problem of the value of existence,
07:01:18 - 07:01:24
had to be precisely a German. I believe not. The event after which this problem was to be
07:01:24 - 07:01:30
expected for certain, an astronomer of the soul could have calculated the very day and hour for
07:01:30 - 07:01:36
it. The decline of the faith in the Christian God, the triumph of scientific atheism, is a generally
07:01:36 - 07:01:42
European event in which all races had their share and for which all deserve credit and honor.
07:01:42 - 07:01:47
Conversely, one might charge precisely the Germans, those Germans who were Schopenhauer's
07:01:47 - 07:01:53
contemporaries, that they delayed this triumph of atheism most dangerously for the longest time.
07:01:54 - 07:01:59
Hegel in particular was its delayer par excellence, with his grandiose attempt to persuade
07:01:59 - 07:02:05
us of the divinity of existence, appealing as a last resort to our sixth sense, the historical
07:02:05 - 07:02:12
sense. As a philosopher, Schopenhauer was the first admitted and inexorable atheist among us Germans.
07:02:13 - 07:02:19
This was the background of his enmity against Hegel. The ungodliness of existence was for him
07:02:19 - 07:02:25
something given, palpable, indisputable. He always lost his philosopher's composure and
07:02:25 - 07:02:29
became indignant when he saw anyone hesitate or mince matters at this point.
07:02:30 - 07:02:35
This is the locus of his whole integrity. Unconditional and honest atheism is simply
07:02:35 - 07:02:40
the presupposition of the way he poses his problem, being a triumph achieved finally
07:02:40 - 07:02:44
and with great difficulty by the European conscience, being the most fateful act of
07:02:44 - 07:02:51
2,000 years of discipline for truth that in the end forbids itself the lie in faith in God.
07:02:51 - 07:02:57
You see what it was that really triumphed over the Christian God, Christian morality itself,
07:02:57 - 07:03:02
the concept of truthfulness that was understood ever more rigorously, the father confessor's
07:03:02 - 07:03:08
refinement of the Christian conscience, translated and sublimated into a scientific conscience,
07:03:08 - 07:03:14
into intellectual cleanliness at any price, looking at nature as if it were proof of the
07:03:14 - 07:03:20
goodness and governance of a God, interpreting history in honor of some divine reason
07:03:20 - 07:03:24
as a continual testimony of a moral world order and ultimate moral purposes,
07:03:25 - 07:03:30
interpreting one's own experiences as pious people have long enough interpreted theirs
07:03:30 - 07:03:36
as if everything were providential, a hint designed and ordained for the sake of the
07:03:36 - 07:03:42
salvation of the soul that is all over now, that has man's conscience against it, that is
07:03:42 - 07:03:48
considered indecent and dishonest by every more refined conscience, mendaciousness, feminism,
07:03:48 - 07:03:55
weakness, and cowardice. In this severity, if anywhere, we are good Europeans and heirs of
07:03:55 - 07:04:01
Europe's longest and most courageous self-overcoming. As we thus reject the Christian interpretation
07:04:01 - 07:04:06
and condemn its meaning-like counterfeit, Schopenhauer's question immediately comes to
07:04:06 - 07:04:12
us in a terrifying way. Has existence any meaning at all? It will require a few centuries before
07:04:12 - 07:04:18
this question can even be heard completely and in its full depth. What Schopenhauer himself said
07:04:18 - 07:04:26
in answer to this question was, forgive me, hasty, youthful, only a compromise, a way of remaining,
07:04:26 - 07:04:32
remaining stuck in precisely those Christian ascetic moral perspectives in which one had
07:04:32 - 07:04:39
renounced faith along with the faith in God. But he posed the question as a good European,
07:04:39 - 07:04:46
as I have said, and not as a German. Or is it possible that at least the manner in which the
07:04:46 - 07:04:52
Germans appropriated Schopenhauer's question proves that the Germans did have an inner affinity,
07:04:52 - 07:04:58
preparation, and need for his problem? That after Schopenhauer won thought and printed
07:04:58 - 07:05:03
things in Germany, too, by the way, late enough, about the problem he had posed,
07:05:03 - 07:05:07
is certainly not sufficient to decide in favor of such an inner affinity.
07:05:08 - 07:05:13
One might rather adduce the peculiar ineptitude of this post-Schopenhauerian pessimism against
07:05:13 - 07:05:18
this thesis. Obviously, the Germans did not behave in this affair as if they had been in
07:05:18 - 07:05:25
their own element. This is not by any means an allusion to Eduard von Hartmann. On the contrary,
07:05:25 - 07:05:29
to this day I have not shaken off my old suspicion that he is too apt for us.
07:05:29 - 07:05:35
I mean that he may have been a wicked rogue from the start who perhaps made fun not only of German
07:05:35 - 07:05:41
pessimism, but in the end he might even bequeath to the Germans in his will how far it was possible
07:05:41 - 07:05:47
even in the age of foundations to make fools of them. But let me ask you, should we perhaps
07:05:47 - 07:05:52
consider that old Hummingtop Bonson as a credit to the Germans, seeing how voluptuously he revolved
07:05:52 - 07:05:58
his life long around his real dialectical misery and his personal tough luck? Perhaps precisely
07:05:58 - 07:06:04
this is German. I herewith recommend his writings for the purpose for which I have used them myself,
07:06:04 - 07:06:10
as an anti-pessimistic diet, especially on account of their elegantiae psychologicae.
07:06:10 - 07:06:14
They should, I think, be effective even for the most constipated bowels and mind.
07:06:15 - 07:06:20
Or could one count such dilettantes and old spinsters as that mawkish apostle of virginity,
07:06:20 - 07:06:27
Mainlander, as a genuine German? In the last analysis he probably was a Jew, all Jews become
07:06:27 - 07:06:34
mawkish when they moralize. Neither Bonson nor Mainlander, not to speak of Eduard von Hartmann,
07:06:35 - 07:06:40
gives us any clear evidence regarding the question whether Schopenhauer's pessimism,
07:06:40 - 07:06:46
his horrified look into a de-deified world that had become stupid, blind, mad, and questionable,
07:06:46 - 07:06:52
his honest horror, was not merely an exceptional case among Germans, but a German event.
07:06:53 - 07:06:59
Everything else that one sees in the foreground, our bold politics and our cheerful fatherlandishness,
07:06:59 - 07:07:05
which resolutely enough consider all matters, with a view to a not very philosophical principle,
07:07:05 - 07:07:12
Deutschland, Deutschland über alles, which means subspecies specie, namely the German species,
07:07:12 - 07:07:18
bears emphatic witness of the opposite. No, the Germans of today are no pessimists,
07:07:18 - 07:07:24
and Schopenhauer was a pessimist, to say it once more, as a good European and not as a German.
07:07:25 - 07:07:26
358
07:07:27 - 07:07:33
The Peasant Rebellion of the Spirit. We Europeans confront a world of tremendous ruins.
07:07:33 - 07:07:38
A few things are still towering, much looks decayed and uncanny, while most things already
07:07:38 - 07:07:44
lie on the ground. It is all very picturesque. Where has one ever seen more beautiful ruins,
07:07:44 - 07:07:49
and overgrown by large and small weeds? The church is this city of destruction.
07:07:49 - 07:07:54
We see the religious community of Christianity shaken to its lowest foundations.
07:07:54 - 07:08:02
The faith in God has collapsed. The faith in the Christian ascetic ideal is still fighting its
07:08:02 - 07:08:07
final battle. An edifice like Christianity, that had been built so carefully over such a long
07:08:07 - 07:08:14
period, it was the last construction of the Romans, naturally could not be destroyed all at once.
07:08:14 - 07:08:20
All kinds of earthquakes had to shake it. All kinds of spirits that bore, dig, gnaw,
07:08:20 - 07:08:26
and moisten have had to help. But what is strangest is this. Those who exerted themselves
07:08:26 - 07:08:32
the most to preserve and conserve Christianity, have become precisely its most efficient destroyers,
07:08:32 - 07:08:36
the Germans. It seems that the Germans do not understand the nature of a church.
07:08:37 - 07:08:43
Are they not spiritual enough for that? Or not mistrustful enough? The edifice of the church
07:08:43 - 07:08:47
at any rate rests on a southern freedom and enlightenment of the spirit, as well as a
07:08:47 - 07:08:54
southern suspicion of nature, man, and spirit. It rests on an altogether different knowledge of man
07:08:54 - 07:09:00
and experience of man than is to be found in the North. The Lutheran Reformation was,
07:09:00 - 07:09:06
in its whole breadth, the indignation of simplicity against multiplicity, or, to speak cautiously,
07:09:06 - 07:09:12
a crude, ingenuous misunderstanding in which there is much that calls for forgiveness.
07:09:12 - 07:09:17
One failed to understand the expression of a triumphant church and saw nothing but corruption.
07:09:18 - 07:09:23
One misunderstood the noble skepticism, that luxury of skepticism and tolerance,
07:09:23 - 07:09:27
which every triumphant, self-assured power permits itself.
07:09:28 - 07:09:32
Today, it is easy enough to see how in all cardinal questions of power,
07:09:32 - 07:09:38
Luther's disposition was calamitously myopic, superficial, and incautious. He was a man of the
07:09:38 - 07:09:43
common people who lacked everything that one might inherit from a ruling caste. He had no
07:09:43 - 07:09:49
instinct for power. Thus his work, his will to restore that Roman work, became, without his
07:09:49 - 07:09:55
knowing or willing it, nothing but the beginning of a work of destruction. He unraveled, he tore
07:09:55 - 07:10:00
up with honest wrath what the old spider had woven so carefully for such a long time. He surrendered
07:10:00 - 07:10:06
the holy books to everybody, until they finally got into the hands of the philologists, who are
07:10:06 - 07:10:12
the destroyers of every faith that rests on books. He destroyed the concept of the church by throwing
07:10:12 - 07:10:18
away the faith in the inspiration of the church councils, for the concept of the church retains
07:10:18 - 07:10:24
its power only on condition that the inspiring spirit that founded the church still lives in it,
07:10:24 - 07:10:30
builds in it, and continues to build its house. He gave back to the priest sexual intercourse
07:10:30 - 07:10:35
with woman, but three-quarters of the reverence of which the common people, especially the women
07:10:35 - 07:10:42
among the common people, are capable, rests on the faith that a person who is an exception at this
07:10:42 - 07:10:48
point will be an exception in other respects as well. It is here that the popular faith in something
07:10:48 - 07:10:56
superhuman in man, in the miracle, in the redeeming God in man, finds its subtlest and most insidious
07:10:56 - 07:11:02
advocate. Luther, having given the priest woman, had to take away from him auricular confession.
07:11:02 - 07:11:07
That was right psychologically. With that development, the Christian priest was, at bottom,
07:11:07 - 07:11:14
abolished, for his most profound utility had always been that he was a holy ear, a silent well,
07:11:14 - 07:11:21
a grave for secrets. Everyone his own priest, behind such formulas and their peasant cunning,
07:11:21 - 07:11:27
there was hidden in Luther the abysmal hatred against the higher human being and the dominion
07:11:27 - 07:11:33
of the higher human beings as conceived by the church. He smashed an ideal that he could not
07:11:33 - 07:11:39
attain, while he seemed to abhor and to be fighting only against the degeneration of this ideal.
07:11:39 - 07:11:45
Actually, he, the man who had found it impossible to be a monk, pushed away the dominion of the
07:11:45 - 07:11:52
homines religiosi, and thus he himself made within the ecclesiastical social order what in relation
07:11:52 - 07:11:57
to the civic social order he attacked so intolerantly, namely, a peasant rebellion.
07:11:58 - 07:12:04
What afterward grew out of his reformation, good as well as bad, might be calculated approximately
07:12:04 - 07:12:09
today. But who would be naive enough to praise or blame Luther on account of these consequences?
07:12:10 - 07:12:16
He is innocent of everything. He did not know what he was doing. The European spirit became
07:12:16 - 07:12:21
shallower, particularly in the North, more good-natured if you prefer a moral term,
07:12:22 - 07:12:26
and there is no doubt that this development advanced a large step with the Lutheran
07:12:26 - 07:12:32
Reformation. The mobility and restlessness of the spirit, its thirst for independence, its faith
07:12:32 - 07:12:38
in a right to liberty, its naturalness, all this also grew owing to the Reformation.
07:12:39 - 07:12:44
If in connection with this last point one wanted to concede it the value of having prepared and
07:12:44 - 07:12:49
favored what we today revere as modern science, one would surely have to add that it also shares
07:12:49 - 07:12:56
the responsibility for the degeneration of the modern scholar, for his lack of reverence, shame,
07:12:56 - 07:13:02
and depth, for the whole naive guilelessness and ostentatious ingenuousness in matters of knowledge,
07:13:02 - 07:13:08
in short, for that plebeianism of the spirit which is a peculiarity of the last two centuries
07:13:08 - 07:13:14
and from which even pessimism has not yet liberated us. Modern ideas also belong to this
07:13:14 - 07:13:21
peasant rebellion of the North against the colder, more ambiguous and mistrustful spirit of the South
07:13:21 - 07:13:27
that built its greatest monument in the Christian Church. Let us not forget in the end what a church
07:13:27 - 07:13:35
is, as opposed to any state. A church is above all a structure for ruling that secures the highest
07:13:35 - 07:13:40
rank for the more spiritual human beings, and that believes in the power of spirituality,
07:13:40 - 07:13:45
to the extent of forbidding itself the use of all the cruder instruments of force.
07:13:46 - 07:13:52
And on this score alone the church is under all circumstances a nobler institution than the state.
07:13:53 - 07:14:01
359. Masson-Rivine. The Revenge Against the Spirit and Other Ulterior Motives of Morality.
07:14:02 - 07:14:08
Morality. Where do you suppose that it finds its most dangerous and insidious advocates?
07:14:08 - 07:14:13
There is a human being who has turned out badly, who does not have enough spirit to be able to
07:14:13 - 07:14:21
enjoy it, but just enough education to realize this. He is bored, disgusted, and despises himself.
07:14:22 - 07:14:28
Having inherited some money, he is deprived even of the last comfort, the blessings of work,
07:14:28 - 07:14:34
self-forgetfulness in daily labor. Such a person who is fundamentally ashamed of his existence,
07:14:35 - 07:14:40
perhaps he also harbors a few little vices, and on the other hand cannot keep himself from
07:14:40 - 07:14:45
becoming more and more spoiled and irritable by reading books to which he is not entitled
07:14:45 - 07:14:51
or by associating with more spiritual company than he can digest. Such a human being who has
07:14:51 - 07:14:58
become poisoned through and through, for spirit becomes poison, education becomes poison,
07:14:58 - 07:15:03
possessions become poison, solitude becomes poison for those who have turned out badly in this way,
07:15:04 - 07:15:12
eventually ends up in a state of habitual revenge, will to revenge. What do you suppose he finds
07:15:12 - 07:15:18
necessary, absolutely necessary, to give himself in his own eyes the appearance of superiority over
07:15:18 - 07:15:23
more spiritual people and to attain the pleasure of an accomplished revenge at least in his
07:15:23 - 07:15:30
imagination? Always morality. You can bet on that. Always big moral words. Always the rub-a-dub of
07:15:30 - 07:15:37
justice, wisdom, holiness, virtue. Always the stoicism of gesture, how well stoicism conceals
07:15:37 - 07:15:44
what one lacks. Always the cloak of prudent silence, of affability, of mildness, and whatever
07:15:44 - 07:15:49
may be the names of all the other idealistic cloaks in which incurable self-despisers,
07:15:49 - 07:15:56
as well as the incurably vain, strut about. Do not misunderstand me. Among such born enemies
07:15:56 - 07:16:01
of the spirit there comes into being occasionally the rare piece of humanity that the common people
07:16:01 - 07:16:09
revere, using such names as saint and sage. It is from among men of this sort that those monsters
07:16:09 - 07:16:14
of morality come who make noise, who make history. Saint Augustine is one of them.
07:16:15 - 07:16:21
Fear of the spirit, revenge against the spirit, how often these propelling vices have become the
07:16:21 - 07:16:28
roots of virtues, even nothing less than virtues. And a confidential question, even the claim that
07:16:28 - 07:16:33
they possessed wisdom, which has been made here and there on earth by philosophers, the maddest
07:16:33 - 07:16:39
and most immodest of all claims, has it not always been to date in India, as well as in Greece, a
07:16:39 - 07:16:46
above all? At times perhaps a screen chosen with pedagogical intent, which hallows so many lies,
07:16:46 - 07:16:51
one has a tender regard for those still in the process of becoming, of growing,
07:16:51 - 07:16:56
for disciples who must often be defended against themselves by means of faith in a person,
07:16:56 - 07:17:02
by means of an error. Much more often, however, it is a screen behind which the philosopher
07:17:02 - 07:17:09
saves himself because he has become weary, old, cold, hard. As a premonition that the
07:17:09 - 07:17:14
end is near, like the prudence animals have before they die, they go off by themselves,
07:17:14 - 07:17:20
become still, choose solitude, hide in caves, and become wise.
07:17:21 - 07:17:26
What? Wisdom as a screen behind which the philosopher hides from spirit?
07:17:28 - 07:17:29
360
07:17:32 - 07:17:34
Two kinds of causes that are often confounded.
07:17:35 - 07:17:41
This seems to me to be one of my most essential steps and advances. I have learned to distinguish
07:17:41 - 07:17:46
the cause of acting from the cause of acting in a particular way, in a particular direction,
07:17:46 - 07:17:52
with a particular goal. The first kind of cause is a quantum of damned-up energy that is waiting
07:17:52 - 07:17:58
to be used up somehow, for something, while the second kind is, compared to this energy,
07:17:58 - 07:18:03
something quite insignificant, for the most part a little accident in accordance with which this
07:18:03 - 07:18:10
quantum discharges itself in one particular way, a match versus a ton of powder. Among these little
07:18:10 - 07:18:16
accidents and matches, I include so-called purposes as well as the even much more so-called
07:18:16 - 07:18:22
vocations. They are relatively random, arbitrary, almost indifferent in relation to the tremendous
07:18:22 - 07:18:29
quantum of energy that presses, as I have said, to be used up somehow. The usual view is different.
07:18:29 - 07:18:35
People are accustomed to consider the goal, purposes, vocations, etc., as the driving force,
07:18:35 - 07:18:41
in keeping with a very ancient error, but it is merely the directing force. One has
07:18:41 - 07:18:46
mistaken the helmsman for the steam, and not even always the helmsman, the directing force.
07:18:47 - 07:18:54
Is the goal, the purpose, not often enough a beautifying pretext, a self-deception of vanity,
07:18:54 - 07:18:58
after the event that does not want to acknowledge that the ship is following the current
07:18:58 - 07:19:03
into which it has entered accidentally, that it wills to go that way because it
07:19:03 - 07:19:08
must? That is, has a direction, to be sure, but no helmsman at all.
07:19:10 - 07:19:12
We still need a critique of the concept of purpose.
07:19:14 - 07:19:15
361
07:19:19 - 07:19:24
On the problem of the actor. The problem of the actor has troubled me for the longest time.
07:19:25 - 07:19:30
I felt unsure, and sometimes still do, whether it is not only from this angle that one can get at
07:19:30 - 07:19:36
the dangerous concept of the artist, a concept that has so far been treated with unpardonable
07:19:36 - 07:19:42
generosity. Falseness with a good conscience, the delight in simulation exploding as a power that
07:19:42 - 07:19:49
pushes aside one's so-called character, flooding it, and at times extinguishing it, the inner
07:19:49 - 07:19:54
craving for a role and mask, for appearance, an excess of the capacity for all kinds of
07:19:54 - 07:19:59
adaptations that can no longer be satisfied in the service of the most immediate and narrowest
07:19:59 - 07:20:05
utility, all of this is perhaps not only peculiar to the actor. Such an instinct will have developed
07:20:05 - 07:20:10
most easily in families of the lower classes, who had to survive under changing pressures and
07:20:10 - 07:20:16
coercions, in deep dependency, who had to cut their coat according to the cloth, always adapting
07:20:16 - 07:20:21
themselves again to new circumstances, who always had to change their mind and posture,
07:20:21 - 07:20:26
until they learned gradually to turn their coat with every wind and thus virtually to become a
07:20:26 - 07:20:31
coat, and masters of the incorporated and inveterate art of eternally playing hide and seek,
07:20:31 - 07:20:37
which in the case of animals is called mimicry, until eventually this capacity,
07:20:37 - 07:20:43
accumulated from generation to generation, becomes domineering, unreasonable, and intractable,
07:20:43 - 07:20:49
an instinct that learns to lord it over other instincts and generates the actor, the artist,
07:20:49 - 07:20:57
the zany, the teller of lies, the buffoon, fool, clown at first, as well as the classical servant,
07:20:57 - 07:21:02
Gilbias, for it is in such types that we find the prehistory of the artist and often enough
07:21:02 - 07:21:09
even of the genius. In superior social conditions too, a similar human type develops under similar
07:21:09 - 07:21:15
pressures. Only in such cases the histrionic instinct is usually barely kept under control
07:21:15 - 07:21:23
by another instinct. For example, in the case of diplomats. Incidentally, I am inclined to believe
07:21:23 - 07:21:28
that a good diplomat would always be free to become a good stage actor if he wished,
07:21:28 - 07:21:35
if only he were free. As for the Jews, the people who possess the art of adaptability par excellence,
07:21:35 - 07:21:39
this train of thought suggests immediately that one might see them virtually as a world
07:21:39 - 07:21:45
historical arrangement for the production of actors, a veritable breeding ground for actors.
07:21:45 - 07:21:53
And it really is high time to ask, what good actor today is not? A Jew. The Jew as a born
07:21:53 - 07:22:00
man of letters, as the true master of the European press, also exercises his power by virtue of his
07:22:00 - 07:22:05
histrionic gifts. For the man of letters is essentially an actor. He plays the expert,
07:22:05 - 07:22:13
the specialist. Finally, women. Reflect on the whole history of women. Do they not have to be
07:22:13 - 07:22:18
first of all and above all else actresses? Listen to physicians who have hypnotized women.
07:22:19 - 07:22:26
Finally, love them. Let yourself be hypnotized by them. What is always the end result? That
07:22:26 - 07:22:31
they put on something even when they take off everything. Woman is so artistic.
07:22:32 - 07:22:40
362. Our faith that Europe will become more viral, we owe it to Napoleon and not by any means to the
07:22:40 - 07:22:46
French Revolution, which aimed at the brotherhood of nations and a blooming universal exchange of
07:22:46 - 07:22:52
hearts, that we now confront a succession of a few warlike centuries that have no parallel
07:22:52 - 07:22:58
in history. In short, that we have entered the classical age of war, of scientific and at the
07:22:58 - 07:23:05
same time popular war on the largest scale in weapons, talents, and discipline. All coming
07:23:05 - 07:23:11
centuries will look back on it with envy and awe for its perfection. For the national movement out
07:23:11 - 07:23:16
of which this war glory is growing is only the counter shock against Napoleon and would not
07:23:16 - 07:23:21
exist except for Napoleon. He should receive credit someday for the fact that in Europe,
07:23:21 - 07:23:26
the man has again become master over the businessman and the philistine and perhaps
07:23:26 - 07:23:30
even over woman who has been pampered by Christianity and the enthusiastic spirit
07:23:30 - 07:23:37
of the 18th century and even more by modern ideas. Napoleon, who considered modern ideas
07:23:37 - 07:23:44
and civilization itself almost as a personal enemy, proved himself through this enmity
07:23:44 - 07:23:49
as one of the greatest continuators of the Renaissance. He brought back again a whole
07:23:49 - 07:23:56
slab of antiquity, perhaps even the decisive piece, the piece of granite. And who knows
07:23:56 - 07:24:01
whether this slab of antiquity might not finally become master again over the national movement
07:24:01 - 07:24:06
and whether it must not become the heir and continuator of Napoleon in an affirmative sense.
07:24:07 - 07:24:11
For what he wanted was one unified Europe, as is known, as mistress of the earth.
07:24:12 - 07:24:20
3 on 63. How each sex has its own prejudice about love. Despite all the concessions that I'm willing
07:24:20 - 07:24:25
to make to the prejudice in favor of monogamy, I will never admit the claim that man and woman
07:24:25 - 07:24:32
have equal rights in love. These do not exist. For man and woman have different conceptions of love
07:24:32 - 07:24:37
and it is one of the conditions of love in both sexes that neither sex presupposes the same
07:24:37 - 07:24:44
feeling and the same concept of love in the other. What woman means by love is clear enough.
07:24:45 - 07:24:51
Total devotion, not mere surrender, with soul and body, without any consideration or reserve,
07:24:52 - 07:24:57
rather with shame and horror at the thought of a devotion that might be subject to special clauses
07:24:57 - 07:25:03
or conditions. In this absence of conditions her love is a faith. Woman has no other faith.
07:25:04 - 07:25:10
Man, when he loves a woman, wants precisely this love from her and is thus himself, as far as can
07:25:10 - 07:25:15
be, from the presupposition of feminine love. Supposing, however, that there should also be
07:25:15 - 07:25:22
men to whom the desire for total devotion is not alien. Well, then they simply are, not men.
07:25:22 - 07:25:28
A man who loves like a woman becomes a slave, while a woman who loves like a woman becomes
07:25:28 - 07:25:35
a more perfect woman. A woman's passion in its unconditional renunciation of rights of her own
07:25:35 - 07:25:42
presupposes precisely that on the other side there is no equal pathos, no equal will to
07:25:42 - 07:25:49
renunciation. For if both partners felt impelled by love to renounce themselves, we should then get,
07:25:49 - 07:25:56
I do not know what, perhaps an empty space? Woman wants to be taken and accepted as a possession,
07:25:56 - 07:26:01
wants to be absorbed into the concept of possession, possessed. Consequently, she wants
07:26:01 - 07:26:07
someone who takes, who does not give himself or give himself away. On the contrary, he is supposed
07:26:07 - 07:26:13
to become richer in himself through the accretion of strength, happiness, and faith given him by the
07:26:13 - 07:26:21
woman who gives herself. Woman gives herself away. Man acquires more. I do not see how one can get
07:26:21 - 07:26:26
around this natural opposition by means of social contracts or with the best will in the world to be
07:26:26 - 07:26:33
just, desirable as it may be, not to remind oneself constantly how harsh, terrible, enigmatic, and
07:26:33 - 07:26:40
immoral this antagonism is. For love thought of in its entirety as great and full is nature, and
07:26:40 - 07:26:46
being nature it is in all eternity something immoral. Faithfulness is accordingly included
07:26:46 - 07:26:52
in woman's love. It follows from the definition. In man it can easily develop in the wake of his
07:26:52 - 07:26:59
love, perhaps as gratitude or as an idiosyncratic taste and so-called elective affinity, but it is
07:26:59 - 07:27:04
not an essential element of his love, so definitely not that one might almost speak with some
07:27:04 - 07:27:10
justification of a natural counterplay of love and faithfulness in man. For his love consists
07:27:10 - 07:27:15
of wanting to have and not of renunciation and giving away. But wanting to have always comes to
07:27:15 - 07:27:22
an end with having. It is actually man's more refined and suspicious lust for possession that
07:27:22 - 07:27:28
rarely admits his having, and then only late, and thus permits his love to persist. It is even
07:27:28 - 07:27:33
possible for his love to increase after the surrender. He will not readily concede that a
07:27:33 - 07:27:44
woman should have nothing more to give him. 364. The Hermit Speaks. The art of associating with
07:27:44 - 07:27:49
people depends essentially on an aptitude, requiring long practice, for accepting and
07:27:49 - 07:27:54
eating a meal in whose cuisine one has no confidence. If you come to the table ravenously
07:27:54 - 07:28:02
hungry, it is all very easy. The worst company can be felt, as Mephistopheles says. But one does not
07:28:02 - 07:28:07
have this ravenous hunger when one needs it. How hard it is to digest one's fellow men!
07:28:08 - 07:28:14
First principle, to summon one's courage as in misfortune, to fall to boldly, to admire
07:28:14 - 07:28:20
oneself in the process, to grit one's teeth on one's repugnance, and to swallow one's nausea.
07:28:20 - 07:28:26
Second principle, to improve one's fellow man, by praise, for example, so that he begins to
07:28:26 - 07:28:32
sweat out his delight in himself, or to grab a corner of his good or interesting qualities,
07:28:32 - 07:28:37
and to pull at it until the whole virtue comes out, and one can hide one's fellow man in its
07:28:37 - 07:28:45
folds. Third principle, auto-suggestion, to fix one's eyes upon the object of association as if
07:28:45 - 07:28:51
it were a glass button, until one ceases to feel any pleasure or displeasure, and goes to sleep
07:28:51 - 07:28:58
unnoticed, grows rigid, and acquires poise, a home remedy amply tested in marriage and friendship,
07:28:58 - 07:29:04
and praised as indispensable, but not yet formulated scientifically. Its popular name is
07:29:05 - 07:29:12
Patience. 365. The hermit speaks once more,
07:29:13 - 07:29:19
We too associate with people. We too modestly don the dress in which as which others know us,
07:29:19 - 07:29:25
respect us, look for us, and then we appear in company, meaning among people who are disguised
07:29:25 - 07:29:31
without wanting to admit it. We too do what all prudent masks do, and in response to every
07:29:31 - 07:29:36
curiosity that does not concern our dress, we politely place a chair against the door.
07:29:36 - 07:29:41
But there are also other ways and tricks when it comes to associating with or passing among men.
07:29:42 - 07:29:47
For example, as a ghost, which is altogether advisable if one wants to get rid of them
07:29:47 - 07:29:53
quickly and make them afraid. Example, one reaches out for us, but gets no hold of us.
07:29:54 - 07:30:00
That is frightening. Or we enter through a closed door, or after all lights have been extinguished,
07:30:00 - 07:30:06
or after we have died. The last is the trick of posthumous people par excellence.
07:30:08 - 07:30:13
What did you think, one of them once asked impatiently, would we feel like enduring the
07:30:13 - 07:30:19
estrangement, the cold and quiet of the grave around us, this whole subterranean, concealed,
07:30:19 - 07:30:25
mute, undiscovered solitude that among us is called life, but might just as well be called
07:30:25 - 07:30:30
death. If we did not know what will become of us, and that it is only after death that we shall
07:30:30 - 07:30:35
enter our life and become alive, oh very much alive, we posthumous people.
07:30:36 - 07:30:41
366. Faced with a Scholarly Book
07:30:42 - 07:30:47
We do not belong to those who have ideas only among books, when stimulated by books. It is
07:30:47 - 07:30:54
our habit to think outdoors, walking, leaping, climbing, dancing, preferably on lonely mountains
07:30:54 - 07:30:59
or near the sea where even the trails become thoughtful. Our first questions about the value
07:30:59 - 07:31:05
of a book, of a human being, or a musical composition are, can they walk, even more,
07:31:05 - 07:31:12
can they dance? We read rarely, but not worse on that account. How quickly we guess how someone has
07:31:12 - 07:31:18
come by his ideas, whether it was while sitting in front of his inkwell, with a pinched belly,
07:31:18 - 07:31:23
his head bowed low over the paper, in which case we are quickly finished with his book too.
07:31:24 - 07:31:29
Cramped intestines betray themselves, you can bet on that, no less than closet air,
07:31:29 - 07:31:36
closet ceilings, closet narrowness. This was what I felt just now as I closed a very decent
07:31:36 - 07:31:43
scholarly book, gratefully, very gratefully, but also with a sense of relief. Almost always the
07:31:43 - 07:31:49
books of scholars are somehow oppressive, oppressed. The specialist emerges somewhere,
07:31:49 - 07:31:55
his zeal, his seriousness, his fury, his overestimation of the nook in which he sits
07:31:55 - 07:32:02
and spins, his hunched back. Every specialist has his hunched back. Every scholarly book also
07:32:02 - 07:32:08
mirrors a soul that has become crooked. Every craft makes crooked. You see the friends of your
07:32:08 - 07:32:12
youth again after they have taken possession of their specialty, and always the opposite has
07:32:12 - 07:32:18
happened too. Always they themselves are now possessed by it and obsessed with it, grown into
07:32:18 - 07:32:25
their nook, crumpled beyond recognition, unfree, deprived of their balance, emaciated and angular
07:32:25 - 07:32:31
all over except for one place where they are downright rotund. One feels moved and falls
07:32:31 - 07:32:36
silent when one sees them again this way. Every craft, even if it should have a golden floor,
07:32:36 - 07:32:41
has a leaden ceiling over it that presses and presses down upon the soul until that becomes
07:32:41 - 07:32:48
queer and crooked. Nothing can be done about that. Let nobody suppose that one could possibly avoid
07:32:48 - 07:32:54
such crippling by some artifice of education. On this earth one pays dearly for every kind of
07:32:54 - 07:32:59
mastery, and perhaps one pays too dearly for everything, for having a specialty one pays by
07:32:59 - 07:33:06
also being the victim of this specialty. But you would have it otherwise. Cheaper and fairer,
07:33:06 - 07:33:12
and above all more comfortable. Isn't that right, my dear contemporaries? Well then, but in that
07:33:12 - 07:33:18
case you also immediately get something else. Instead of the craftsman and master, the man of
07:33:18 - 07:33:25
letters, the dexterous, polydexterous man of letters who, to be sure, lacks the hunched back,
07:33:25 - 07:33:31
not counting the posture he assumes before you, being the salesman of the spirit and the carrier
07:33:31 - 07:33:36
of culture, the man of letters who really is nothing but represents almost everything,
07:33:36 - 07:33:42
playing and substituting for the expert, and taking it upon himself in all modesty to get himself
07:33:42 - 07:33:49
paid, honored, and celebrated in place of the expert. No, my scholarly friends, I bless you
07:33:49 - 07:33:56
even for your hunched backs, and for despising, as I do, the men of letters and culture parasites,
07:33:57 - 07:34:02
and for not knowing how to make a business of the spirit, and for having opinions that cannot
07:34:02 - 07:34:07
be translated into financial values, and for not representing anything that you are not,
07:34:08 - 07:34:13
and because your sole aim is to become masters of your craft with reverence for every kind of
07:34:13 - 07:34:18
mastery and competence, and with uncompromising opposition to everything that is semblance,
07:34:18 - 07:34:25
half-genuine, dressed-up, virtuoso-like, demagogical, or histrionic in literis et
07:34:25 - 07:34:31
artibus, to everything that cannot prove to you its unconditional probity in discipline and prior
07:34:31 - 07:34:38
training. Even genius does not compensate for such a deficiency, however much it may deceive people
07:34:38 - 07:34:44
about it. This becomes clear to anyone who has ever watched our most gifted painters and musicians
07:34:44 - 07:34:50
from nearby. All of them, with scarcely any exception, know how to use cunning inventions
07:34:50 - 07:34:56
of manners, of makeshift devices, and even of principles to give themselves, after the event,
07:34:56 - 07:35:02
an artificial semblance of such probity, of such solidity of training and culture, without,
07:35:02 - 07:35:07
of course, managing to deceive themselves, without silencing for good their own bad conscience.
07:35:08 - 07:35:12
For you surely know that all great modern artists suffer from a guilty conscience.
07:35:14 - 07:35:17
367
07:35:20 - 07:35:25
The first distinction to be made regarding works of art. All thought, poetry, painting,
07:35:25 - 07:35:30
compositions, even buildings and sculptures, belong either to monological art or to art before
07:35:30 - 07:35:36
witnesses. In the second class we must include even the apparently monological art that involves
07:35:36 - 07:35:41
faith in God, the whole lyricism of prayer. For the pious there is as yet no solitude.
07:35:42 - 07:35:47
This invention was made only by us, the godless. I do not know of any more profound difference in
07:35:47 - 07:35:52
the whole orientation of an artist than this, whether he looks at his work in progress,
07:35:52 - 07:35:57
at himself, from the point of view of the witness, or whether he has forgotten the world,
07:35:57 - 07:36:03
which is the essential feature of all monological art. It is based on forgetting,
07:36:03 - 07:36:07
it is the music of forgetting. 368
07:36:07 - 07:36:14
The cynic speaks. My objections to the music of Wagner are physiological objections.
07:36:15 - 07:36:17
Why should I trouble to dress them up in aesthetic formulas?
07:36:18 - 07:36:23
My fact is that I no longer breathe easily once this music begins to affect me,
07:36:23 - 07:36:29
that my foot soon resents it and rebels. My foot feels the need for rhythm, dance, march.
07:36:29 - 07:36:34
It demands of music first of all those delights which are found in good walking, striding,
07:36:34 - 07:36:41
leaping, and dancing. But does not my stomach protest too? My heart? My circulation? My
07:36:41 - 07:36:48
intestines? Do I not become hoarse as I listen? And so I ask myself, what is it that my whole
07:36:48 - 07:36:56
body really expects of music? I believe its own ease. As if all animal function should be quickened
07:36:56 - 07:37:03
by easy, bold, exuberant, self-assured rhythms. As if iron-leaden life should be gilded by good
07:37:03 - 07:37:08
golden and tender harmonies. My melancholy wants to rest in the hiding places and abysses of
07:37:08 - 07:37:15
perfection. That is why I need music. What is the drama to me? What the convulsions of its
07:37:15 - 07:37:21
moral ecstasies which give the common people satisfaction? What, the whole gesture hocus
07:37:21 - 07:37:27
pocus of the actor? You will guess that I am essentially anti-theatrical, but Wagner was
07:37:27 - 07:37:34
conversely, essentially, a man of the theater and an actor, the most enthusiastic memomaniac
07:37:34 - 07:37:40
of all time also as a musician. And incidentally, if it was Wagner's theory that the drama is the
07:37:40 - 07:37:46
end, the music is always a mere means. His practice was always from beginning to end.
07:37:46 - 07:37:51
The pose is the end. The drama, also the music, is always merely a means to that.
07:37:52 - 07:38:00
Music as a means to clarify, strengthen, and lend inward dimension to the dramatic gesture
07:38:00 - 07:38:06
and the actor's appeal to the senses. And the Wagnerian drama, a mere occasion for many
07:38:06 - 07:38:12
dramatic poses. Besides all other instincts, he had the commanding instincts of a great actor
07:38:12 - 07:38:19
in absolutely everything, and, as already mentioned, also as a musician. I once made
07:38:19 - 07:38:24
this clear to an upright Wagnerian, not without trouble, and I had reasons for adding,
07:38:24 - 07:38:29
do be a little more honest with yourself. After all, we are not in the theater.
07:38:29 - 07:38:32
In the theater one is honest only in the mass.
07:38:32 - 07:38:36
As an individual one lies, one lies to oneself.
07:38:36 - 07:38:40
One leaves oneself at home when one goes to the theater.
07:38:40 - 07:38:45
One renounces the right to one's own tongue and choice, to one's taste, even to one's
07:38:45 - 07:38:51
courage as one has it and exercises it between one's own four walls against both God and
07:38:51 - 07:38:52
man.
07:38:52 - 07:38:57
No one brings along the finest senses of his art to the theater, nor does the artist who
07:38:57 - 07:38:59
works for the theater.
07:38:59 - 07:39:07
There one is common people, audience, herd, female, pharisee, voting cattle, democrat,
07:39:07 - 07:39:09
neighbor, fellow man.
07:39:09 - 07:39:13
There even the most personal conscience is vanquished by the leveling magic of the great
07:39:13 - 07:39:15
number.
07:39:15 - 07:39:20
There stupidity has the effect of lasciviousness and contagion.
07:39:20 - 07:39:21
The neighbor reigns.
07:39:21 - 07:39:25
One becomes a mere neighbor.
07:39:25 - 07:39:30
I forgot to mention how my enlightened Wagnerian replied to these physiological objections.
07:39:30 - 07:39:36
Then you really are merely not healthy enough for our music?
07:39:36 - 07:39:40
369.
07:39:40 - 07:39:42
Our side by side.
07:39:42 - 07:39:47
Don't we have to admit to ourselves, we artists, that there is an uncanny difference within
07:39:47 - 07:39:50
us between our taste and our creative power?
07:39:50 - 07:39:56
They stand oddly side by side, separately, and each grows in its own way.
07:39:56 - 07:40:02
I mean they have altogether different degrees and tempi of old, young mature, mellow, and
07:40:02 - 07:40:03
rotten.
07:40:03 - 07:40:08
A musician, for example, might create his lifelong what is utterly at odds with what
07:40:08 - 07:40:13
his refined listener's ear and listener's heart esteem enjoy and prefer, and he need
07:40:13 - 07:40:16
not even be aware of this contradiction.
07:40:16 - 07:40:22
As our almost painfully frequent experience shows, one's taste can easily grow far beyond
07:40:22 - 07:40:27
the reach of the taste of one's powers, and this need not at all paralyze these powers
07:40:27 - 07:40:30
and keep them from continued productivity.
07:40:30 - 07:40:34
But the opposite can happen, too, and this is what I should like to call to the attention
07:40:34 - 07:40:37
of artists.
07:40:37 - 07:40:42
Consider a continually creative person, a mother type in the grand sense, one who knows
07:40:42 - 07:40:47
and hears nothing anymore except about the pregnancies and deliveries of his spirit,
07:40:47 - 07:40:52
one who simply lacks the time to reflect on himself and his work, and to make comparisons,
07:40:52 - 07:40:58
one who no longer has any desire to assert his taste, and who simply forgets it, without
07:40:58 - 07:41:03
caring in the least whether it still stands, or lies, or falls.
07:41:03 - 07:41:08
Such a person might perhaps eventually produce works that far excel his own judgment, so
07:41:08 - 07:41:13
that he utters stupidities about them and himself, utters them and believes them.
07:41:13 - 07:41:17
This seems to me to be almost the norm among fertile artists.
07:41:17 - 07:41:21
Nobody knows a child less well than its parents do.
07:41:21 - 07:41:25
And it is true, even in the case, to take a tremendous example, of the whole world of
07:41:25 - 07:41:30
Greek art and poetry, it never knew what it did.
07:41:30 - 07:41:35
370 What is Romanticism?
07:41:35 - 07:41:39
It may perhaps be recalled, at least among my friends, that initially I approached the
07:41:39 - 07:41:46
modern world with a few crude errors and overestimations and, in any case, hopefully.
07:41:46 - 07:41:51
Who knows on the basis of what personal experiences I understood the philosophical pessimism of
07:41:51 - 07:41:56
the nineteenth century as if it were a symptom of a superior force of thought, of more audacious
07:41:56 - 07:42:01
courage and of more triumphant fullness of life than had characterized the eighteenth
07:42:01 - 07:42:07
century, the age of Hume, Kant, Kondylak, and the sensualists.
07:42:07 - 07:42:12
Thus tragic insight appeared to me, as the distinctive luxury of our culture, as its
07:42:12 - 07:42:19
most precious, noblest, and most dangerous squandering, but, in view of its over-richness,
07:42:19 - 07:42:21
as a permissible luxury.
07:42:21 - 07:42:26
In the same way, I reinterpreted German music for myself as if it signified a Dionysian
07:42:26 - 07:42:29
power of the German soul.
07:42:29 - 07:42:33
I believed that I heard in it the earthquake through which some primeval force that had
07:42:33 - 07:42:39
been damned up for ages finally liberated itself, indifferent whether everything else
07:42:39 - 07:42:43
that one calls culture might begin to tremble.
07:42:43 - 07:42:48
You see, what I failed to recognize at that time, both in philosophical pessimism and
07:42:48 - 07:42:54
in German music, was what is really their distinctive character, their Romanticism.
07:42:54 - 07:42:56
What is Romanticism?
07:42:56 - 07:43:01
Every art, every philosophy may be viewed as a remedy and an aid in the service of growing
07:43:01 - 07:43:03
and struggling life.
07:43:03 - 07:43:06
They always presuppose suffering and sufferers.
07:43:06 - 07:43:08
But there are two kinds of sufferers.
07:43:08 - 07:43:14
First, those who suffer from the over-fullness of life, they want a Dionysian art, and likewise
07:43:14 - 07:43:17
a tragic view of life, a tragic insight.
07:43:17 - 07:43:24
And then those who suffer from the impoverishment of life and seek rest, stillness, calm seas,
07:43:24 - 07:43:31
redemption from themselves through art and knowledge, or intoxication, convulsions, anesthesia,
07:43:31 - 07:43:33
and madness.
07:43:33 - 07:43:38
All Romanticism in art and insight corresponds to the dual needs of the latter type, and
07:43:38 - 07:43:44
that included and includes Schopenhauer as well as Richard Wagner, to name the two most
07:43:44 - 07:43:51
famous and pronounced Romantics whom I misunderstood at that time, not, incidentally, to their
07:43:51 - 07:43:56
disadvantage, as one need not hesitate in all fairness to admit.
07:43:56 - 07:44:01
He that is richest in the fullness of life, the Dionysian God and man, cannot only afford
07:44:01 - 07:44:06
the sight of the terrible and questionable, but even the terrible deed and any luxury
07:44:06 - 07:44:09
of destruction, decomposition, and negation.
07:44:09 - 07:44:17
In his case, what is evil, absurd, and ugly seems, as it were, permissible, owing to an
07:44:17 - 07:44:23
excess of procreating, fertilizing energies that can still turn any desert into lush farmland.
07:44:23 - 07:44:28
Conversely, those who suffer most and are poorest in life would need above all mildness,
07:44:28 - 07:44:34
peacefulness, and goodness in thought as well as deed, if possible, also a God, who would
07:44:34 - 07:44:40
be truly a God for the sick, a healer and savior, also logic, the conceptual understandability
07:44:40 - 07:44:42
of existence.
07:44:42 - 07:44:47
For logic calms and gives confidence, in short, a certain warm narrowness that keeps away
07:44:47 - 07:44:52
fear and encloses one in optimistic horizons.
07:44:52 - 07:44:57
Thus I gradually learned to understand Epicurus, the opposite of a Dionysian pessimist, also
07:44:57 - 07:45:01
the Christian, who is actually only a kind of Epicurean.
07:45:01 - 07:45:04
Both are essentially romantics.
07:45:04 - 07:45:09
And my eye grew ever sharper for that most difficult and captious form of backward inference
07:45:09 - 07:45:15
in which the most mistakes are made, the backward inference from the work to the maker, from
07:45:15 - 07:45:19
the deed to the doer, from the ideal to those who need it, from every way of thinking and
07:45:19 - 07:45:24
valuing to the commanding need behind it.
07:45:24 - 07:45:28
Regarding all aesthetic values, I now avail myself of this main distinction.
07:45:28 - 07:45:36
I ask in every instance, is it hunger or superabundance that has here become creative?
07:45:36 - 07:45:39
At first glance, another distinction may seem preferable.
07:45:39 - 07:45:46
It is far more obvious, namely the question whether the desire to fix, to immortalize,
07:45:46 - 07:45:51
the desire for being prompted creation, or the desire for destruction, for change, for
07:45:51 - 07:45:54
future, for becoming.
07:45:54 - 07:45:59
But both of these kinds of desire are seen to be ambiguous when one considers them more
07:45:59 - 07:46:00
closely.
07:46:00 - 07:46:05
They can be interpreted in accordance with the first scheme that is, as it seems to me,
07:46:05 - 07:46:06
preferable.
07:46:06 - 07:46:13
The desire for destruction, change, and becoming can be an expression of an overflowing energy
07:46:13 - 07:46:15
that is pregnant with future.
07:46:15 - 07:46:19
My term for this is, as is known, Dionysian.
07:46:19 - 07:46:25
But it can also be the hatred of the ill-constituted, disinherited, and underprivileged, who destroy
07:46:25 - 07:46:33
must destroy, because what exists, indeed all existence, all being, outrages and provokes
07:46:33 - 07:46:34
them.
07:46:34 - 07:46:38
To understand this feeling, consider our anarchists closely.
07:46:38 - 07:46:42
The will to immortalize also requires a dual interpretation.
07:46:42 - 07:46:46
It can be prompted first by gratitude and love.
07:46:46 - 07:46:52
Art with this origin will always be an art of apotheoses, perhaps dithyrambic like Rubens,
07:46:52 - 07:46:57
or blissfully mocking like Hafiz, or bright and gracious like Goethe, spreading a Homeric
07:46:57 - 07:47:00
light and glory over all things.
07:47:00 - 07:47:05
But it can also be the tyrannic will of one who suffers deeply, who struggles, is tormented,
07:47:05 - 07:47:10
and would like to turn what is most personal, singular, and narrow, the real idiosyncrasy
07:47:10 - 07:47:17
of his suffering, into a binding law and compulsion, one who, as it were, revenges himself on all
07:47:17 - 07:47:22
things by forcing his own image, the image of his torture, on them, branding them with
07:47:22 - 07:47:24
it.
07:47:24 - 07:47:30
This last version is romantic pessimism in its most expressive form, whether it be Schopenhauer's
07:47:30 - 07:47:34
philosophy of will, or Wagner's music.
07:47:34 - 07:47:38
Romantic pessimism, the last great event in the fate of our culture.
07:47:38 - 07:47:43
That there still could be an altogether different kind of pessimism, a classical type.
07:47:43 - 07:47:49
This premonition and vision belongs to me as inseparable from me, as my proprium and
07:47:49 - 07:47:50
ipsissimum.
07:47:50 - 07:47:53
Only the word classical offends my ears.
07:47:53 - 07:47:56
It is far too trite and has become round and indistinct.
07:47:56 - 07:48:04
I call this pessimism of the future, for it comes, I see it coming, Dionysian pessimism.
07:48:04 - 07:48:09
371
07:48:09 - 07:48:15
We incomprehensible ones, have we ever complained because we are misunderstood, misjudged, misidentified,
07:48:15 - 07:48:19
slandered, misheard, and not heard?
07:48:19 - 07:48:22
Precisely this is our fate, oh, for a long time yet.
07:48:22 - 07:48:25
Let us say to be modest until 1901.
07:48:25 - 07:48:27
It is also our distinction.
07:48:27 - 07:48:31
We should not honor ourselves sufficiently if we wished that it were otherwise.
07:48:31 - 07:48:37
We are misidentified, because we ourselves keep growing, keep changing.
07:48:37 - 07:48:38
We shed our old bark.
07:48:38 - 07:48:40
We shed our skins every spring.
07:48:40 - 07:48:45
We keep becoming younger, fuller of future, taller, stronger.
07:48:45 - 07:48:52
We push our roots ever more powerfully into the depths, into evil, while at the same time
07:48:52 - 07:48:57
we embrace the heavens ever more lovingly, more broadly, imbibing their light ever more
07:48:57 - 07:49:01
thirstily with all our twigs and leaves.
07:49:01 - 07:49:08
Like trees we grow, this is hard to understand, as is all of life, not in one place only,
07:49:08 - 07:49:15
but everywhere, not in one direction, but equally upward and outward and inward and
07:49:15 - 07:49:16
downward.
07:49:16 - 07:49:21
Our energy is at work simultaneously in the trunk, branches, and roots.
07:49:21 - 07:49:27
We are no longer free to do only one particular thing, to be only one particular thing.
07:49:27 - 07:49:30
This is our fate, as I have said.
07:49:30 - 07:49:35
We grow in height, and even if this should be our fatality, for we dwell ever closer
07:49:35 - 07:49:40
to the lightning, well, we do not on that account honor it less.
07:49:40 - 07:49:46
It remains that which we do not wish to share to make public, the fatality of the heights,
07:49:46 - 07:49:48
our fatality.
07:49:48 - 07:49:50
372
07:49:53 - 07:49:55
Why We Are No Idealists
07:49:55 - 07:49:58
Formerly philosophers were afraid of the senses.
07:49:58 - 07:50:01
Have we perhaps unlearned this fear too much?
07:50:01 - 07:50:07
Today all of us are believers in the senses, we philosophers of the present and the future,
07:50:07 - 07:50:10
not in theory but in praxis, in practice.
07:50:10 - 07:50:14
They however thought that the senses might lure them away from their own world, from
07:50:14 - 07:50:19
the cold realm of ideas to some dangerous southern island where they feared that their
07:50:19 - 07:50:23
philosophers' virtues might melt away like snow in the sun.
07:50:23 - 07:50:28
Having wax in one's ears was then almost a condition of philosophizing.
07:50:28 - 07:50:33
A real philosopher no longer listened to life insofar as life is music.
07:50:33 - 07:50:36
He denied the music of life.
07:50:36 - 07:50:41
It is an ancient philosopher's superstition that all music is siren's music.
07:50:41 - 07:50:45
We today are inclined to make the opposite judgment, which actually could be equally
07:50:45 - 07:50:51
wrong, namely that ideas are worse seductresses than our senses for all their cold and anemic
07:50:51 - 07:50:55
appearance, and not even in spite of this appearance.
07:50:55 - 07:50:58
They have always lived on the blood of the philosopher.
07:50:58 - 07:51:04
They always consumed his senses and even, if you will believe us, his heart.
07:51:04 - 07:51:07
These old philosophers were heartless.
07:51:07 - 07:51:10
Philosophizing was always a kind of vampirism.
07:51:10 - 07:51:15
Looking at these figures, even Spinoza, don't you have a sense of something profoundly enigmatic
07:51:15 - 07:51:16
and uncanny?
07:51:16 - 07:51:19
Don't you notice the spectacle that unrolls before you?
07:51:19 - 07:51:21
How they become ever paler?
07:51:21 - 07:51:25
How decentralization is interpreted more and more ideally?
07:51:25 - 07:51:30
Don't you sense a long-concealed vampire in the background who begins with the senses
07:51:30 - 07:51:36
and in the end is left with, and leaves, mere bones, mere clatter?
07:51:36 - 07:51:43
I mean categories, formulas, words, for forgive me, what was left of Spinoza, amor intellectualis
07:51:43 - 07:51:47
dei, is mere clatter and no more than that.
07:51:47 - 07:51:52
What is amor, what deus, if there is not a drop of blood in them?
07:51:52 - 07:51:58
In sum, all philosophical idealism to date was something like a disease, unless it was,
07:51:58 - 07:52:04
as it was in Plato's case, the caution of an over-rich and dangerous health, the fear
07:52:04 - 07:52:09
of over-powerful senses, the prudence of a prudent Socratic.
07:52:09 - 07:52:14
Perhaps we moderns are merely not healthy enough to be in need of Plato's idealism,
07:52:14 - 07:52:16
and we are not afraid of the senses because...
07:52:16 - 07:52:21
3.73
07:52:21 - 07:52:24
Science as a Prejudice
07:52:24 - 07:52:29
It follows from the laws of the order of rank that scholars, insofar as they belong to the
07:52:29 - 07:52:33
spiritual middle class, can never catch sight of the really great problems and question
07:52:33 - 07:52:34
marks.
07:52:34 - 07:52:40
Moreover, their courage and their eyes simply do not reach that far, and above all, their
07:52:40 - 07:52:44
needs which led them to become scholars in the first place, their inmost assumptions
07:52:44 - 07:52:49
and desires that things might be such and such, their fears and hopes all come to rest
07:52:49 - 07:52:52
and are satisfied too soon.
07:52:52 - 07:52:56
Take for example that pedantic Englishman, Herbert Spencer.
07:52:56 - 07:53:01
What makes him enthuse in his way, and then leads him to draw a line of hope, a horizon
07:53:01 - 07:53:03
of desirability?
07:53:03 - 07:53:09
That eventual reconciliation of egoism and altruism, about which he raves, almost nauseates
07:53:09 - 07:53:10
the likes of us.
07:53:10 - 07:53:15
A human race that adopted such Spenserian perspectives as its ultimate perspectives
07:53:15 - 07:53:19
would seem to us worthy of contempt, of annihilation.
07:53:19 - 07:53:24
But the mere fact that he had to experience as his highest hope something that to others
07:53:24 - 07:53:30
appears and may appear only as a disgusting possibility poses a question mark that Spencer
07:53:30 - 07:53:33
would have been incapable of foreseeing.
07:53:33 - 07:53:37
It is no different with the faith with which so many materialistic natural scientists rest
07:53:37 - 07:53:43
content nowadays, the faith in a world that is supposed to have its equivalent and its
07:53:43 - 07:53:49
measure in human thought and human valuations, a world of truth that can be mastered completely
07:53:49 - 07:53:52
and forever with the aid of our square little reason.
07:53:52 - 07:53:54
What?
07:53:54 - 07:53:59
Do we really want to permit existence to be degraded for us like this, reduced to a mere
07:53:59 - 07:54:04
exercise for a calculator and an indoor diversion for mathematicians?
07:54:04 - 07:54:09
Above all, one should not wish to divest existence of its rich ambiguity.
07:54:09 - 07:54:14
That is a dictate of good taste, gentlemen, the taste of reverence for everything that
07:54:14 - 07:54:20
lies beyond your horizon, that the only justifiable interpretation of the world should be one
07:54:20 - 07:54:25
in which you are justified because one can continue to work and do research scientifically
07:54:25 - 07:54:27
in your sense.
07:54:27 - 07:54:29
You really mean mechanistically?
07:54:29 - 07:54:35
An interpretation that permits counting, calculating, weighing, seeing, and touching, and nothing
07:54:35 - 07:54:36
more.
07:54:36 - 07:54:42
That is a crudity and naivete, assuming that it is not a mental illness, an idiocy.
07:54:42 - 07:54:47
Would it not be rather probable that, conversely, precisely the most superficial and external
07:54:47 - 07:54:54
aspect of existence, what is most apparent, its skin and sensualization, would be grasped
07:54:54 - 07:54:59
first, and might even be the only thing that allowed itself to be grasped?
07:54:59 - 07:55:04
A scientific interpretation of the world, as you understand it, might therefore still
07:55:04 - 07:55:09
be one of the most stupid of all possible interpretations of the world, meaning that
07:55:09 - 07:55:12
it would be one of the poorest in meaning.
07:55:12 - 07:55:17
This thought is intended for the ears and consciences of our mechanists, who nowadays
07:55:17 - 07:55:22
like to pass as philosophers and insist that mechanics is the doctrine of the first and
07:55:22 - 07:55:28
last laws on which all existence must be based as on a ground floor.
07:55:28 - 07:55:32
But an essentially mechanical world would be an essentially meaningless world, assuming
07:55:32 - 07:55:37
that one estimated the value of a piece of music according to how much of it could be
07:55:37 - 07:55:41
counted, calculated, and expressed in formulas.
07:55:41 - 07:55:45
How absurd would such a scientific estimation of music be?
07:55:45 - 07:55:48
What would one have comprehended, understood, grasped of it?
07:55:48 - 07:55:53
Nothing, really nothing, of what is music in it.
07:55:53 - 07:55:59
374 Our New Infinite
07:55:59 - 07:56:03
How far the perspective character of existence extends, or indeed whether existence has any
07:56:03 - 07:56:06
other character than this.
07:56:06 - 07:56:12
Whether existence without interpretation, without sense, does not become nonsense.
07:56:12 - 07:56:18
Where on the other hand, all existence is not essentially actively engaged in interpretation.
07:56:18 - 07:56:24
That cannot be decided even by the most industrious and most scrupulously conscientious analysis
07:56:24 - 07:56:27
and self-examination of the intellect.
07:56:27 - 07:56:31
For in the course of this analysis, the human intellect cannot avoid seeing itself in its
07:56:31 - 07:56:35
own perspectives, and only in these.
07:56:35 - 07:56:37
We cannot look around our own corner.
07:56:37 - 07:56:42
It is a hopeless curiosity that wants to know what other kinds of intellects and perspectives
07:56:42 - 07:56:44
there might be.
07:56:44 - 07:56:49
For example, whether some beings might be able to experience time backward, or alternately
07:56:49 - 07:56:54
forward and backward, which would involve another direction of life and another concept
07:56:54 - 07:56:56
of cause and effect.
07:56:56 - 07:57:01
But I should think that today, we are at least far from the ridiculous immodesty that would
07:57:01 - 07:57:06
be involved in decreeing from our corner, that perspectives are permitted only from
07:57:06 - 07:57:07
this corner.
07:57:07 - 07:57:13
Rather has the world become infinite for us all over again, inasmuch as we cannot reject
07:57:13 - 07:57:18
the possibility that it may include infinite interpretations.
07:57:18 - 07:57:21
Once more we are seized by a great shudder.
07:57:21 - 07:57:26
But who would feel inclined immediately to deify again, after the old manner this monster
07:57:26 - 07:57:28
of an unknown world?
07:57:28 - 07:57:32
And to worship the unknown henceforth as the unknown one?
07:57:32 - 07:57:38
Alas, too many ungodly possibilities of interpretation are included in the unknown, too much devilry,
07:57:38 - 07:57:44
stupidity, and foolishness of interpretation, even our own human, all too human folly, which
07:57:44 - 07:57:47
we know.
07:57:47 - 07:57:50
375
07:57:50 - 07:57:53
Why we look like Epicureans
07:57:53 - 07:57:57
We are cautious, we modern men, about ultimate convictions.
07:57:57 - 07:58:01
Our mistrust lies in wait for the enchantments and deceptions of the conscience that are
07:58:01 - 07:58:07
involved in every strong faith, every unconditional yes and no.
07:58:07 - 07:58:10
How is this to be explained?
07:58:10 - 07:58:15
Perhaps what is to be found here is largely the care of the burned child, of the disappointed
07:58:15 - 07:58:17
idealist.
07:58:17 - 07:58:23
But there is also another, superior component, the jubilant curiosity of one who formerly
07:58:23 - 07:58:28
stood in his corner and was driven to despair by his corner, and now delights and luxuriates
07:58:28 - 07:58:35
in the opposite of a corner, in the boundless, in what is free as such.
07:58:35 - 07:58:39
Thus an almost Epicurean bent for knowledge develops that will not easily let go of the
07:58:39 - 07:58:44
questionable character of things, also an aversion to big moral words and gestures,
07:58:44 - 07:58:50
a taste that rejects all crude, four-square opposites, and is proudly conscious of its
07:58:50 - 07:58:52
practice in having reservations.
07:58:52 - 07:58:58
For this constitutes our pride, this slight tightening of the reins as our urge for certainty
07:58:58 - 07:59:04
races ahead, this self-control of the rider during his wildest rides, for we still ride
07:59:04 - 07:59:12
mad and fiery horses, and when we hesitate it is least of all danger that makes us hesitate.
07:59:12 - 07:59:18
376 Our Slow Periods
07:59:18 - 07:59:23
This is how all artists and people of works feel, the motherly human type.
07:59:23 - 07:59:28
At every division of their lives, which are always divided by a work, they believe that
07:59:28 - 07:59:30
they have reached their goal.
07:59:30 - 07:59:35
They would always patiently accept death with the feeling, now we are ripe for it.
07:59:35 - 07:59:41
This is not the expression of weariness, rather of a certain autumnal sunniness and mildness
07:59:41 - 07:59:46
that the work itself, the fact that the work has become ripe, always leaves behind in the
07:59:46 - 07:59:47
author.
07:59:47 - 07:59:51
Then the tempo of life slows down and becomes thick like honey.
07:59:51 - 07:59:57
Even to the point of Long Fermata, of the faith in Long Fermata.
07:59:57 - 08:00:02
377 We Who Are Homeless
08:00:02 - 08:00:06
Among Europeans today there is no lack of those who are entitled to call themselves
08:00:06 - 08:00:09
homeless in a distinctive and honorable sense.
08:00:09 - 08:00:14
It is to them that I especially commend my secret wisdom and gaia scienza.
08:00:14 - 08:00:19
For their fate is hard, their hopes are uncertain, it is quite a feat to devise some comfort
08:00:19 - 08:00:25
for them. But what avail? We children of the future, how could we be at home in this today?
08:00:26 - 08:00:30
We feel disfavor for all ideals that might lead one to feel at home even in this fragile,
08:00:30 - 08:00:36
broken time of transition. As for its realities, we do not believe that they will last.
08:00:37 - 08:00:42
The ice that still supports people today has become very thin. The wind that brings the thaw
08:00:42 - 08:00:49
is blowing. We ourselves, who are homeless, constitute a force that breaks open ice and
08:00:49 - 08:00:57
other all-too-thin realities. We conserve nothing. Neither do we want to return to any past periods.
08:00:57 - 08:01:04
We are not by any means liberal. We do not work for progress. We do not need to plug up our ears
08:01:04 - 08:01:10
against the sirens who in the marketplace sing of the future. Their song about equal rights,
08:01:10 - 08:01:16
a free society, no more masters and no servants has no allure for us. We simply do not consider
08:01:16 - 08:01:20
it desirable that a realm of justice and concord should be established on earth,
08:01:21 - 08:01:24
because it would certainly be the realm of the deepest leveling and chinoiserie.
08:01:25 - 08:01:32
We are delighted with all who love, as we do, danger, war, and adventures, who refuse to
08:01:32 - 08:01:39
compromise, to be captured, reconciled, and castrated. We count ourselves among conquerors.
08:01:39 - 08:01:45
We think about the necessity for new orders, also for a new slavery, for every strengthening
08:01:45 - 08:01:51
and enhancement of the human type also involves a new kind of enslavement. Is it not clear that
08:01:51 - 08:01:55
with all this we are bound to feel ill at ease in an age that likes to claim the distinction
08:01:55 - 08:02:00
of being the most humane, the mildest, and the most righteous age that the sun has ever seen?
08:02:01 - 08:02:06
It is bad enough that precisely when we hear these beautiful words we have the ugliest suspicions.
08:02:06 - 08:02:12
What we find in them is merely an expression, and a masquerade, of a profound weakening,
08:02:12 - 08:02:20
of weariness, of old age, of declining energies. What can it matter to us what tinsel the sick may
08:02:20 - 08:02:26
use to cover up their weakness? Let them parade it as their virtue. After all, there is no doubt
08:02:26 - 08:02:34
that weakness makes one mild, oh, so mild, so righteous, so inoffensive, so humane. The religion
08:02:34 - 08:02:40
of pity, to which one would like to convert us, oh, we know the hysterical little males and females
08:02:40 - 08:02:45
well enough who today need precisely this religion as a veil and make-up. We are no
08:02:45 - 08:02:51
humanitarians. We should never dare to permit ourselves to speak of our love of humanity.
08:02:52 - 08:02:58
Our kind is not actor enough for that, or not Saint-Simoniste enough, not French enough.
08:02:58 - 08:03:03
One really has to be afflicted with a gallic excess of erotic irritability and enamored
08:03:03 - 08:03:10
impatience to approach in all honesty the whole of humanity with one's lust, humanity.
08:03:11 - 08:03:16
Has there ever been a more hideous old woman among all old women, unless it were truth a
08:03:16 - 08:03:23
question for philosophers? No, we do not love humanity, but on the other hand we are not nearly
08:03:23 - 08:03:29
German enough, in the sense in which the word German is constantly being used nowadays to
08:03:29 - 08:03:34
advocate nationalism and race hatred and to be able to take pleasure in the national scabies
08:03:34 - 08:03:40
of the heart and blood poisoning that now leads the nations of Europe to delimit and barricade
08:03:40 - 08:03:45
themselves against each other as if it were a matter of quarantine. For that we are too
08:03:45 - 08:03:52
open-minded, too malicious, too spoiled, also too well-informed, too traveled. We far prefer to live
08:03:52 - 08:03:58
on mountains apart, untimely, in past or future centuries, merely in order to keep ourselves from
08:03:58 - 08:04:04
experiencing the silent rage to which we know we should be condemned as eyewitnesses of politics
08:04:04 - 08:04:10
that are desolating the German spirit by making it vain and that is moreover petty politics.
08:04:10 - 08:04:16
To keep its own creation from immediately falling apart again, is it not finding it necessary to
08:04:16 - 08:04:22
plant it between two deadly hatreds? Must it not desire the eternalization of the European
08:04:22 - 08:04:28
system of a lot of petty states? We who are homeless are too manifold and mixed racially
08:04:28 - 08:04:33
and in our descent being modern men and consequently do not feel tempted to participate
08:04:33 - 08:04:39
in the mendacious racial self-admiration and racial indecency that parades in Germany today
08:04:39 - 08:04:44
as a sign of a German way of thinking and that is doubly false and obscene among the people
08:04:44 - 08:04:51
of the historical sense. We are in one word, and let this be our word of honor, good Europeans,
08:04:51 - 08:04:57
the heirs of Europe, the rich oversupplied but also overly obligated heirs of thousands of years
08:04:57 - 08:05:05
of European spirit. As such, we have also outgrown Christianity and are averse to it precisely
08:05:05 - 08:05:11
because we have grown out of it, because our ancestors were Christians who in their Christianity
08:05:11 - 08:05:17
were uncompromisingly upright. For their faith they willingly sacrificed possessions and position,
08:05:17 - 08:05:25
blood and fatherland. We do the same. For what? For our unbelief? For every kind of unbelief?
08:05:25 - 08:05:30
No. You know better than that, friends. The hidden yes in you is stronger than all nos and
08:05:30 - 08:05:36
maybes that afflict you and your age like a disease. And when you have to embark on the sea,
08:05:36 - 08:05:43
you emigrants, you too, are compelled to this by a faith. Murray, 378.
08:05:45 - 08:05:52
And become bright again. We, open-handed and rich in spirit, standing by the road like open wells
08:05:52 - 08:05:57
with no intention to fend off anyone who feels like drawing from us, we unfortunately do not
08:05:57 - 08:06:02
know how to defend ourselves where we want to. We have no way of preventing people from darkening us.
08:06:03 - 08:06:09
The time in which we live throws into us what is most time-bound. Its dirty birds drop their filth
08:06:09 - 08:06:15
into us, boys their gyugas, and exhausted wanderers who come to us to rest, their little and large
08:06:15 - 08:06:22
miseries. But we shall do what we have always done. Whatever one casts into us, we take down
08:06:22 - 08:06:29
into our depth, for we are deep, we do not forget, and become bright again. 379.
08:06:31 - 08:06:37
The fool interrupts. The writer of this book is no misanthrope. Today one pays too dearly for
08:06:37 - 08:06:43
hatred of man. If one would hate the way man was hated formerly, tamonically, wholly, without
08:06:43 - 08:06:49
exception, with a full heart, with the whole love of hatred, then one would have to renounce contempt.
08:06:49 - 08:06:55
And how much fine joy, how much patience, how much graciousness even do we owe precisely to
08:06:55 - 08:07:02
our contempt. Moreover, it makes us the elect of God. Refined contempt is our taste and privilege,
08:07:02 - 08:07:08
our art, our virtue, perhaps, as we are the most modern of moderns. Hatred, on the other hand,
08:07:08 - 08:07:15
places people on a par vis-a-vis. In hatred there is honor. Finally, in hatred there is fear,
08:07:15 - 08:07:21
a good and ample element of fear. We fearless ones, however, we more spiritual human beings
08:07:21 - 08:07:27
of this age, we know our own advantage well enough to live without fear of this age precisely because
08:07:27 - 08:07:33
we are more spiritual. We shall hardly be decapitated, imprisoned, or exiled. Not even
08:07:33 - 08:07:39
our books will be banned or burned. The age loves the spirit. It loves and needs us,
08:07:39 - 08:07:43
even if we should have to make clear to it that we are virtuosos of contempt,
08:07:44 - 08:07:50
that every association with human beings makes us shudder slightly, that for all our mildness,
08:07:50 - 08:07:55
patience, geniality, and politeness we cannot persuade our nose to give up its prejudice
08:07:55 - 08:08:00
against the proximity of a human being, that we love nature the less humanly it behaves,
08:08:00 - 08:08:06
and art when it is the artist's escape from man, or the artist's mockery of man,
08:08:06 - 08:08:10
or the artist's mockery of himself. 380
08:08:12 - 08:08:16
The Wanderer Speaks If one would like to see our European morality
08:08:16 - 08:08:21
for once as it looks from a distance, and if one would like to measure it against other
08:08:21 - 08:08:26
moralities past and future, then one has to proceed like a wanderer who wants to know how
08:08:26 - 08:08:32
high the towers in a town are. He leaves the town. Thoughts about moral prejudices, if they
08:08:32 - 08:08:38
are not meant to be prejudices about prejudices, presuppose a position outside morality, some point
08:08:38 - 08:08:44
beyond good and evil to which one has to rise, climb, or fly, and in the present case at least
08:08:44 - 08:08:51
a point beyond our good and evil, a freedom from everything European, by which I mean the sum of
08:08:51 - 08:08:56
the imperious value judgments that have become part of our flesh and blood. That one wants to
08:08:56 - 08:09:04
go precisely out there, up there, maybe a minor madness, a peculiar and unreasonable you must,
08:09:04 - 08:09:09
for we seekers for knowledge also have our idiosyncrasies of unfree will, the question
08:09:09 - 08:09:15
is whether one really can get up there. This may depend on manifold conditions,
08:09:15 - 08:09:20
in the main the question is how light or heavy we are, the problem of our specific gravity,
08:09:21 - 08:09:26
one has to be very light to drive one's will to knowledge into such a distance and, as it were,
08:09:26 - 08:09:33
beyond one's time to create for oneself eyes to survey millennia and moreover clear skies in these
08:09:33 - 08:09:41
eyes. One must have liberated oneself from many things that oppress, inhibit, hold down, and make
08:09:41 - 08:09:48
heavy precisely us Europeans today. The human being of such a beyond who wants to behold the
08:09:48 - 08:09:54
supreme measures of value of his time must first of all overcome this time in himself,
08:09:55 - 08:10:00
this is the test of his strength and consequently not only his time but also his prior aversion and
08:10:00 - 08:10:07
contradiction against this time, his suffering from this time, his untimeliness, his romanticism.
08:10:08 - 08:10:10
381
08:10:10 - 08:10:17
On the question of being understandable, one does not only wish to be understood when one writes,
08:10:17 - 08:10:23
one wishes just as surely not to be understood. It is not by any means necessarily an objection
08:10:23 - 08:10:28
to a book when anyone finds it impossible to understand, perhaps that was part of the
08:10:28 - 08:10:34
author's intention, he did not want to be understood by just anybody. All the nobler
08:10:35 - 08:10:42
spirits and tastes select their audience when they wish to communicate, and choosing that,
08:10:43 - 08:10:48
one at the same time erects barriers against the others. All the more subtle laws of any
08:10:48 - 08:10:54
style have their origin at this point, they at the same time keep away, create a distance,
08:10:54 - 08:11:00
forbid entrance, understanding, as said above, while they open the ears of those whose ears
08:11:00 - 08:11:05
are related to ours. And let me say this among ourselves and about my own case,
08:11:06 - 08:11:11
I don't want either my ignorance or the liveliness of my temperament to keep me from being
08:11:11 - 08:11:16
understandable for you, my friends, not the liveliness, however much it compels me to
08:11:16 - 08:11:23
tackle a matter swiftly to tackle it at all. For I approach deep problems like cold baths,
08:11:23 - 08:11:28
quickly into them and quickly out again. That one does not get to the depths that way,
08:11:28 - 08:11:33
not deep enough down, is the superstition of those afraid of the water, the enemies of cold
08:11:33 - 08:11:41
water. They speak without experience. The freezing cold makes one swift. And to ask this incidentally,
08:11:41 - 08:11:46
does a matter necessarily remain ununderstood and unfathomed, merely because it has been
08:11:46 - 08:11:52
touched only in flight, glanced at, in a flash? Is it absolutely imperative that one settles down
08:11:52 - 08:11:59
on it, that one has brooded over it as over an egg? Deo noctuque incubando, as Newton said of
08:11:59 - 08:12:05
himself? At least there are truths that are singularly shy and ticklish and cannot be
08:12:05 - 08:12:12
caught except suddenly, that must be surprised or left alone. Finally, my brevity has yet another
08:12:12 - 08:12:18
value. Given such questions as concern me, I must say many things briefly in order that they may be
08:12:18 - 08:12:26
heard still more briefly. For, being an immoralist, one has to take steps against corrupting innocents,
08:12:26 - 08:12:30
I mean asses and old maids of both sexes, whom life offers nothing but their innocence.
08:12:31 - 08:12:36
Even more, my writings should inspire, elevate and encourage them to be virtuous.
08:12:37 - 08:12:42
I cannot imagine anything on earth that would be a merrier sight than inspired old asses and
08:12:42 - 08:12:48
maids who feel excited by the sweet sentiments of virtue, and this I have seen. Thus spoke
08:12:48 - 08:12:55
Zarathustra. So much regarding brevity. Matters stand worse with my ignorance, which I do not
08:12:55 - 08:13:01
try to conceal from myself. There are hours when I feel ashamed of it, to be sure, also hours when
08:13:01 - 08:13:06
I feel ashamed of feeling ashamed. Perhaps all of us philosophers are in a bad position nowadays
08:13:06 - 08:13:12
regarding knowledge. Science keeps growing, and the most scholarly among us are close to
08:13:12 - 08:13:18
discovering that they know too little. But it would be still worse if it were different. And we knew
08:13:18 - 08:13:26
too much. Our task is and remains, above all, not to mistake ourselves for others. We are something
08:13:26 - 08:13:32
different from scholars, although it is unavoidable for us to be also, among other things, scholarly.
08:13:33 - 08:13:39
We have different needs, grow differently, and also have a different digestion. We need more,
08:13:39 - 08:13:45
we also need less. How much a spirit needs for its nourishment, for this there is no formula.
08:13:45 - 08:13:51
But if its taste is for independence, for quick coming and going, for roaming perhaps for
08:13:51 - 08:13:56
adventures, for which only the swiftest are a match, it is better for such a spirit to live
08:13:56 - 08:14:02
in freedom with little to eat than unfree and stuffed. It is not fat but the greatest possible
08:14:02 - 08:14:07
suppleness and strength that a good dancer desires from his nourishment. And I would
08:14:07 - 08:14:12
not know what the spirit of a philosopher might wish more to be than a good dancer.
08:14:12 - 08:14:20
For the dance is his ideal, also his art, and finally also his only piety, his service of God.
08:14:20 - 08:14:31
382. The great health. Being new, nameless, hard to understand, we premature births of an as yet
08:14:31 - 08:14:37
unproven future need for a new goal, also a new means, namely, a new health, stronger, more
08:14:37 - 08:14:43
seasoned, tougher, more audacious, and gayer than any previous health. Whoever has a soul that
08:14:43 - 08:14:49
craves to have experienced the whole range of values and desiderata to date, and to have sailed
08:14:49 - 08:14:54
around all the coasts of this ideal Mediterranean, whoever wants to know from the adventures of his
08:14:54 - 08:15:01
own most authentic experience how a discoverer and conqueror of the ideal feels, and also an artist,
08:15:01 - 08:15:09
a saint, a legislator, a sage, a scholar, a pious man, a soothsayer, and one who stands divinely
08:15:09 - 08:15:15
apart in the old style, needs one thing above everything else, the great health, that one does
08:15:15 - 08:15:21
not merely have but also acquires continually, and must acquire because one gives it up again
08:15:21 - 08:15:28
and again, and must give it up. And now, after we have long been on our way in this manner,
08:15:28 - 08:15:34
we argonauts of the ideal, with more daring perhaps than is prudent, and have suffered shipwreck and
08:15:34 - 08:15:40
damage often enough, but are, to repeat it, healthier than one likes to permit us, dangerously
08:15:40 - 08:15:48
healthy, ever again healthy, it will seem to us as if, as a reward, we now confronted an as yet
08:15:48 - 08:15:53
undiscovered country whose boundaries nobody has surveyed yet, something beyond all the lands and
08:15:53 - 08:16:00
nooks of the ideal so far, a world so over-rich in what is beautiful, strange, questionable,
08:16:00 - 08:16:07
terrible, and divine that our curiosity, as well as our craving to possess it, has got beside itself.
08:16:07 - 08:16:14
Alas, now nothing will sate us anymore. After such vistas, and with such a burning hunger in
08:16:14 - 08:16:21
our conscience and science, how could we still be satisfied with present-day man? It may be too bad,
08:16:21 - 08:16:25
but it is inevitable that we find it difficult to remain serious when we look at his worthiest
08:16:25 - 08:16:32
goals and hopes, and perhaps we do not even bother to look anymore. Another ideal runs ahead of us,
08:16:32 - 08:16:37
a strange, tempting, dangerous ideal to which we should not wish to persuade anybody
08:16:37 - 08:16:44
because we do not readily concede the right to it to anyone, the ideal of a spirit who plays naively,
08:16:44 - 08:16:50
that is, not deliberately but from overflowing power and abundance, with all that was hitherto
08:16:50 - 08:16:56
called holy, good, untouchable, divine, for whom those supreme things that the people naturally
08:16:56 - 08:17:03
accept as their value standards signify danger, decay, debasement, or at least recreation,
08:17:03 - 08:17:10
blindness, and temporary self-oblivion, the ideal of a human, superhuman well-being
08:17:10 - 08:17:17
and benevolence that will often appear inhuman, for example, when it confronts all earthly
08:17:17 - 08:17:25
seriousness so far, all solemnity in gesture, word, tone, eye, morality, and task so far,
08:17:25 - 08:17:30
as if it were their most incarnate and involuntary parody, and in spite of all of this,
08:17:30 - 08:17:35
it is perhaps only with him that great seriousness really begins, that the real
08:17:35 - 08:17:40
question mark is posed for the first time, that the destiny of the soul changes,
08:17:40 - 08:17:46
the hand moves forward, the tragedy begins. 383
08:17:46 - 08:17:55
Epilogue. But as I slowly, slowly paint this gloomy question mark at the end,
08:17:55 - 08:17:59
and am still willing to remind my readers of the virtues of the right reader, what forgotten and
08:17:59 - 08:18:04
unknown virtues they are, it happens that I hear all around me the most malicious,
08:18:04 - 08:18:10
cheerful, and koboldish laughter, the spirits of my own book are attacking me, pull my ears,
08:18:10 - 08:18:15
and call me back to order. We can no longer stand it, they shout at me,
08:18:16 - 08:18:20
away, away, with this raven black music, are we not surrounded by bright morning,
08:18:21 - 08:18:27
and by soft green grass and grounds, the kingdom of the dance, has there ever been a better hour
08:18:27 - 08:18:34
for gaiety, who will sing a song for us, a morning song so sunny, so light, so fledged,
08:18:34 - 08:18:38
that it will not chase away the blues, but invite them instead to join in the singing and dancing,
08:18:39 - 08:18:44
and even simple, rustic bagpipes would be better than such mysterious sounds,
08:18:44 - 08:18:49
such swampy croaking, voices from the grave and marmot whistles as you have employed so far to
08:18:49 - 08:18:55
regale us in your wilderness, Mr. Hermit and musician of the future, no, not such tones,
08:18:55 - 08:19:01
let us strike up more agreeable, more joyous tones, is that your pleasure, my impatient friends,
08:19:01 - 08:19:08
well then, who would not like to please you, my bagpipes are waiting, and so is my throat,
08:19:08 - 08:19:12
which may sound a bit rough, but put up with it, after all, we are in the mountains,
08:19:12 - 08:19:17
at least what you are about to hear is new, and if you do not understand it,
08:19:17 - 08:19:23
if you misunderstand the singer, what does it matter, that happens to be the singer's curse,
08:19:24 - 08:19:29
his music and manner, you will be able to hear that much better, and to his pipes,
08:19:29 - 08:19:34
dance that much better, is that your will, appendix,
08:19:34 - 08:19:37
songs of prince Vogelfrei,
08:20:05 - 08:20:31
the indestructible is but your invention,
08:20:31 - 08:20:38
got, the ineluctable poetic pretension, world wheel while rolling on skims aim on aim,
08:20:39 - 08:20:44
fate, says the sullen one, fools call it a game, world game, the ruling force,
08:20:44 - 08:20:51
blends false and true, the eternally fooling force blends us in too, the poets call,
08:20:52 - 08:20:57
in the woods upon the ground, I was sitting at my leisure, when a distant ticking sound
08:20:57 - 08:21:04
seemed to beat an endless measure, I got mad, began to show it, there was nothing I could do,
08:21:04 - 08:21:08
until I, just like a poet, spoke in that strange tick-tock too,
08:21:09 - 08:21:15
how to make me so in the verse silp around silp her hopsa jumped, I suddenly had to laugh,
08:21:15 - 08:21:23
laugh for a quarter of an hour, you a poet, you a poet, is it so bad with your head,
08:21:24 - 08:21:31
yes my lord, you are a poet, axel plucks the bird's beak, whose hair am I here in the bush,
08:21:31 - 08:21:38
to whom am I luring robbers, is it a saying, a picture, in the hush my rhyme sits on it,
08:21:39 - 08:21:45
what only slips and hops, the poet immediately stumbles upon the verse, yes my lord,
08:21:45 - 08:21:51
you are a poet, axel plucks the bird's beak, rhymes, I mean, are like arrows,
08:21:52 - 08:21:58
how it rattles, trembles, jumps, when the arrow penetrates noble parts of the lazartan body,
08:21:59 - 08:22:03
ach, ihr sterbt dran, arme Wichter, oder taumelt wie bezächt,
08:22:04 - 08:22:09
ja mein herr, sie sind ein Dichter, axel zuckt der Vogel Specht.
08:22:09 - 08:22:14
Schiefe Sprüchlein voller Eile, trunkne Wörtlein, wie sich's drängt,
08:22:14 - 08:22:19
bis ihr alle, Zeil an Zeile, an der Tick-Tack-Kette hängt.
08:22:19 - 08:22:22
Und es gibt grausam Gelichter, dass dies...
08:22:22 - 08:22:24
Freut? Sind Dichter schlecht?
08:22:24 - 08:22:27
Ja, mein Herr, sie sind ein Dichter.
08:22:27 - 08:22:29
Axel zuckt der Vogelspecht.
08:22:29 - 08:22:32
Höhnst du, Vogel? Willst du scherzen?
08:22:32 - 08:22:34
Steht's mit meinem Kopf schon schlimm,
08:22:34 - 08:22:36
schlimmer stünd's mit meinem Herzen?
08:22:36 - 08:22:38
I kept making verses.
08:22:38 - 08:22:40
After lots of them did their ding-dong,
08:22:40 - 08:22:42
I was overcome by laughter
08:22:42 - 08:22:44
and laughed fifteen minutes long.
08:22:44 - 08:22:47
You a poet? You a poet?
08:22:47 - 08:22:49
Has your head become that sick?
08:22:49 - 08:22:51
Yes, my friend, you are a poet,
08:22:51 - 08:22:52
mocks the pecker with a flick.
08:22:52 - 08:22:54
I'm a robber.
08:22:54 - 08:22:56
What's the quarry I await here, wasting time?
08:22:56 - 08:22:58
Maxim.
08:22:58 - 08:22:59
Image?
08:22:59 - 08:23:02
I am sorry, I have pinned you with a rhyme.
08:23:02 - 08:23:04
All that runs or leaps.
08:23:04 - 08:23:05
I slow it down to rhyme.
08:23:05 - 08:23:07
Nothing's too quick.
08:23:07 - 08:23:10
Yes, my friend, you are a poet,
08:23:10 - 08:23:12
mocks the pecker with a flick.
08:23:12 - 08:23:14
Rhymes are deadly little arrows.
08:23:14 - 08:23:16
See the tremor, see the quiver
08:23:16 - 08:23:18
when they pierce the vital marrows
08:23:18 - 08:23:20
of the lizard or his liver.
08:23:20 - 08:23:22
You are dying, and you know it,
08:23:22 - 08:23:24
or real like a lunatic.
08:23:24 - 08:23:26
Yes, my friend, you are a poet,
08:23:26 - 08:23:28
mocks the pecker with a flick.
08:23:28 - 08:23:30
Silly Maxims made in haste,
08:23:30 - 08:23:33
drunken phrases crowd in pain,
08:23:33 - 08:23:35
wriggling, lined up to my taste,
08:23:35 - 08:23:37
on the silly TikTok chain.
08:23:37 - 08:23:40
Scalawags that dared you rue it.
08:23:40 - 08:23:42
This you like?
08:23:42 - 08:23:44
Are poets sick?
08:23:44 - 08:23:46
Yes, my friend, you are a poet,
08:23:46 - 08:23:48
mocks the pecker with a flick.
08:23:48 - 08:23:50
Is this meant to be a joke?
08:23:50 - 08:23:53
First you said my head was ill,
08:23:53 - 08:23:55
now my heart you pecking bloke.
08:23:55 - 08:23:58
Fürchte, fürchte meinen Grimm.
08:23:58 - 08:24:00
Doch der Dichter,
08:24:00 - 08:24:02
Reime flicht er selbst im Grimm
08:24:02 - 08:24:04
noch schlecht und recht.
08:24:04 - 08:24:07
Ja, mein Herr, Sie sind ein Dichter.
08:24:07 - 08:24:10
Axel zuckt der Vogelspecht.
08:24:10 - 08:24:12
Im Süden
08:24:12 - 08:24:14
So hänge ich denn auf krummem Aste
08:24:14 - 08:24:16
und schaukle meine Müdigkeit.
08:24:16 - 08:24:18
Ein Vogel lud mich her zu Gaste.
08:24:18 - 08:24:21
Ein Vogelnest ist's, drin ich raste.
08:24:21 - 08:24:24
Wo bin ich doch? Ach weit, ach weit.
08:24:24 - 08:24:26
Das weiße Meer liegt eingeschlafen
08:24:26 - 08:24:29
und purpuren steht ein Segel drauf.
08:24:29 - 08:24:32
Fels, Feigenbäume, Turm und Hafen,
08:24:32 - 08:24:35
Idylle rings, Geblök von Schafen.
08:24:35 - 08:24:38
Unschuld des Südens, nimm mich auf.
08:24:38 - 08:24:41
Nur Schritt für Schritt, das ist kein Leben.
08:24:41 - 08:24:43
Stets Bein vor Bein macht Deutsch und schwer.
08:24:43 - 08:24:46
Ich hieß den Wind mich aufwärts heben.
08:24:46 - 08:24:48
Ich lernte mit den Vögeln schweben.
08:24:48 - 08:24:50
Nach Süden flog ich übers Meer.
08:24:50 - 08:24:53
Vernunft, verdrießliches Geschäfte.
08:24:53 - 08:24:56
Das bringt uns allzu bald ans Ziel.
08:24:56 - 08:24:59
Im Fliegen lernt ich, was mich äfte.
08:24:59 - 08:25:01
Schon fühl ich Mut und Blut und Säfte
08:25:01 - 08:25:04
zu neuem Leben, neuem Spiel.
08:25:04 - 08:25:06
Einsam zu denken nenn ich weise,
08:25:06 - 08:25:09
doch einsam singen wäre dumm.
08:25:09 - 08:25:11
So hört ein Lied zu eurem Preise
08:25:11 - 08:25:14
und setzt euch still um mich im Kreise,
08:25:14 - 08:25:16
ihr schlimmen Vögelchen herum.
08:25:16 - 08:25:19
So jung, so falsch, so umgetrieben
08:25:19 - 08:25:21
scheint ganz ihr mir gemacht zum Lieben
08:25:21 - 08:25:24
fear, oh fear my evil will.
08:25:24 - 08:25:27
But the poet rhymes, although it angers him.
08:25:27 - 08:25:29
He has a tick.
08:25:29 - 08:25:31
Yes, my friend, you are a poet,
08:25:31 - 08:25:33
mocks the pecker with a flick.
08:25:33 - 08:25:35
In the South
08:25:35 - 08:25:37
On a crooked branch I sway
08:25:37 - 08:25:39
and rock my weariness to rest.
08:25:39 - 08:25:41
A bird invited me to stay,
08:25:41 - 08:25:44
and I sit in a bird-built nest.
08:25:44 - 08:25:46
But where am I?
08:25:46 - 08:25:48
Far, far away.
08:25:48 - 08:25:50
The white sea stretches fast asleep,
08:25:50 - 08:25:53
a crimson sail, bucolic scents,
08:25:53 - 08:25:56
a rock, fig trees, the harbors sweep,
08:25:56 - 08:25:59
idles around me, bleeding sheep.
08:25:59 - 08:26:01
Accept me, southern innocence.
08:26:01 - 08:26:03
Step upon step.
08:26:03 - 08:26:05
This heavy stride is German, not life.
08:26:05 - 08:26:07
A disease.
08:26:07 - 08:26:09
To lift me up, I asked the breeze,
08:26:09 - 08:26:11
and with the birds I learned to glide.
08:26:11 - 08:26:14
Southward I flew across the seas.
08:26:14 - 08:26:16
Reason is businesslike,
08:26:16 - 08:26:19
a flood that brings us too soon to our aim.
08:26:19 - 08:26:21
In flight I rose above the mud,
08:26:21 - 08:26:23
now I have courage, sap, and blood
08:26:23 - 08:26:26
for a new life, for a new game.
08:26:26 - 08:26:28
To think in solitude is wise,
08:26:28 - 08:26:30
singing in solitude is silly.
08:26:30 - 08:26:33
Hence I shall sing, dear birds, your praise,
08:26:33 - 08:26:35
and you shall listen willy-nilly,
08:26:35 - 08:26:38
you wicked, dear birds, to my lays.
08:26:38 - 08:26:41
So young, so false, so full of schemes,
08:26:41 - 08:26:44
you seem to live in loving dreams
08:26:44 - 08:26:46
and jedem schönen Zeitvertreib.
08:26:46 - 08:26:49
Im Norden, ich gesteh's mit zaudern,
08:26:50 - 08:26:53
liebt ich ein Weibchen, alt zum schaudern.
08:26:53 - 08:26:56
Die Wahrheit hieß dies alte Weib.
08:26:59 - 08:27:01
Solang noch hübsch mein Leibchen,
08:27:01 - 08:27:03
lohnt sich's schon, fromm zu sein.
08:27:03 - 08:27:06
Man weiß, Gott liebt die Weibchen,
08:27:06 - 08:27:08
die hübschen obendrein.
08:27:08 - 08:27:10
Er wird's dem armen Mönchlein
08:27:10 - 08:27:12
gewisslich gern verzeihen,
08:27:12 - 08:27:14
dass er, gleich manchem Mönchlein,
08:27:14 - 08:27:16
so gern will bei mir sein.
08:27:16 - 08:27:18
Kein grauer Kirchenvater.
08:27:18 - 08:27:21
Nein, jung noch und oft rot,
08:27:21 - 08:27:23
oft trotz dem grausten Kater
08:27:23 - 08:27:25
voll Eifersucht und Not.
08:27:25 - 08:27:27
Ich liebe nicht die Greise.
08:27:27 - 08:27:29
Er liebt die Alten nicht.
08:27:29 - 08:27:32
Wie wunderlich und weise hat Gott dies eingericht.
08:27:32 - 08:27:34
Die Kirche weiß zu leben.
08:27:34 - 08:27:36
Sie prüft Herz und Gesicht.
08:27:36 - 08:27:39
Stets will sie mir vergeben.
08:27:39 - 08:27:41
Ja, wer vergibt mir nicht?
08:27:41 - 08:27:43
Man lispelt mit dem Mündchen,
08:27:43 - 08:27:45
man knickst und geht hinaus,
08:27:45 - 08:27:47
und mit dem neuen Sündchen
08:27:47 - 08:27:49
sieht man das Alte aus.
08:27:49 - 08:27:51
Gelobt sei Gott auf Erden,
08:27:51 - 08:27:53
der hübsche Mädchen liebt
08:27:53 - 08:27:55
und derlei Herzbeschwerden
08:27:55 - 08:27:57
sich selber gern vergibt.
08:27:57 - 08:27:59
So lang noch hübsch mein Leibchen,
08:27:59 - 08:28:01
attuned to all the games of youth.
08:28:01 - 08:28:03
Up north. Embarrassing to tell.
08:28:03 - 08:28:05
I loved a creepy ancient bell.
08:28:05 - 08:28:08
The name of this old hag was Truth.
08:28:08 - 08:28:11
Pius Bepper.
08:28:11 - 08:28:13
As long as I look classy,
08:28:13 - 08:28:15
piety is no pity.
08:28:15 - 08:28:17
You know, God loves a lassie,
08:28:17 - 08:28:19
at least if she is pretty.
08:28:19 - 08:28:21
And my poor little monk,
08:28:21 - 08:28:23
he'll pardon cheerfully,
08:28:23 - 08:28:25
that like many a monk,
08:28:25 - 08:28:27
he loves to be with me.
08:28:27 - 08:28:29
No church father who's sallow,
08:28:29 - 08:28:31
but blushing youthful greed.
08:28:31 - 08:28:33
Hungover, they still wallow
08:28:33 - 08:28:35
in jealousy and need.
08:28:35 - 08:28:37
He does not love old age.
08:28:37 - 08:28:39
The old are not my line.
08:28:39 - 08:28:41
How marvelous and sage
08:28:41 - 08:28:43
is our Lord's design.
08:28:43 - 08:28:45
It tries the heart and face,
08:28:45 - 08:28:47
sees me, and will forgive.
08:28:47 - 08:28:49
Who does not show me grace?
08:28:49 - 08:28:51
One lisps of deep chagrin,
08:28:51 - 08:28:53
a curtsy, and goodbye.
08:28:53 - 08:28:55
And with another sin,
08:28:55 - 08:28:57
one wipes old sins away.
08:28:57 - 08:28:59
Praise be to God,
08:28:59 - 08:29:01
who lives and loves the pretty maids,
08:29:01 - 08:29:03
and who gladly forgives himself
08:29:03 - 08:29:05
his escapades.
08:29:05 - 08:29:07
As long as I look classy,
08:29:07 - 08:29:09
lohnt sich's schon fromm zu sein.
08:29:09 - 08:29:11
Als altes Wackelweibchen
08:29:11 - 08:29:13
der geheimnisvolle Nachen.
08:29:15 - 08:29:17
Gestern Nachts, als alles schlief,
08:29:17 - 08:29:19
kaum der Wind mit ungewissen
08:29:19 - 08:29:21
Seufzern durch die Gassen lief,
08:29:21 - 08:29:23
gab mir Ruhe nicht das Kissen,
08:29:23 - 08:29:25
noch der Mohn, noch was sonst
08:29:25 - 08:29:27
tief schlafen macht, ein Gutgewissen.
08:29:27 - 08:29:29
Endlich schlug ich mir
08:29:29 - 08:29:31
den Schlaf aus dem Sinn
08:29:31 - 08:29:33
und lief zum Strande.
08:29:33 - 08:29:35
Mondhell war's und mild,
08:29:35 - 08:29:37
ich traf Mann und Kahn
08:29:37 - 08:29:39
auf warmem Sande, schläfrig beide,
08:29:39 - 08:29:41
Hirt und Schaf,
08:29:41 - 08:29:43
schläfrig stieß der Kahn vom Lande.
08:29:43 - 08:29:45
Eine Stunde, leicht auch zwei,
08:29:45 - 08:29:47
oder war's ein Jahr,
08:29:47 - 08:29:49
da sanken plötzlich mir Sinn
08:29:49 - 08:29:51
und Gedanken in ein ewiges Einerlei,
08:29:51 - 08:29:53
und ein Abgrund ohne Schranken
08:29:53 - 08:29:55
tat sich auf, da war's vorbei.
08:29:55 - 08:29:57
Morgen kam,
08:29:57 - 08:29:59
auf schwarzen Tiefen steht
08:29:59 - 08:30:01
ein Kahn und ruht und ruht.
08:30:01 - 08:30:03
Was geschah? So rief's?
08:30:03 - 08:30:05
So riefen hundert bald?
08:30:05 - 08:30:07
Was gab es? Blut?
08:30:07 - 08:30:09
Nichts geschah.
08:30:09 - 08:30:11
Wir schliefen, schliefen alle.
08:30:11 - 08:30:13
Ach, so gut, so gut!
08:30:13 - 08:30:15
Liebeserklärung
08:30:15 - 08:30:17
Bei der aber
08:30:17 - 08:30:19
der Dichter in eine Grube fiel, Kuh!
08:30:19 - 08:30:21
O Wunder! Fliegt er noch?
08:30:21 - 08:30:23
Er steigt empor.
08:30:23 - 08:30:25
Und seine Flügel ruhn?
08:30:25 - 08:30:27
Was hebt und trägt ihn doch?
08:30:27 - 08:30:29
Was ist ihm Ziel und Zug und Zügel nun?
08:30:29 - 08:30:31
Piety is no pity.
08:30:31 - 08:30:33
When I am old and gassy,
08:30:33 - 08:30:35
the devil take my kitty.
08:30:35 - 08:30:37
The Mysterious Bark
08:30:37 - 08:30:39
Last night all appeared to doze,
08:30:39 - 08:30:41
unsteady the wind that wailed
08:30:41 - 08:30:43
softly lest it break repose.
08:30:43 - 08:30:45
Only I on my bed
08:30:45 - 08:30:47
flailed, poppy and good conscience,
08:30:47 - 08:30:49
those trusted soporifics
08:30:49 - 08:30:51
failed. Finally
08:30:51 - 08:30:53
I forswore sleep, got up
08:30:53 - 08:30:55
and ran to the strand.
08:30:55 - 08:30:57
There was moonlight
08:30:57 - 08:30:59
where it's steep, man and bark
08:30:59 - 08:31:01
on the warm sand, sleepy
08:31:01 - 08:31:03
both shepherd and sheep.
08:31:03 - 08:31:05
Sleepily we left the land.
08:31:05 - 08:31:07
One hour passed, or two,
08:31:07 - 08:31:09
or three, or a year,
08:31:09 - 08:31:11
when suddenly all my thoughts
08:31:11 - 08:31:13
and mind were drowned in timeless monotony.
08:31:13 - 08:31:15
An abyss without a ground
08:31:15 - 08:31:17
opened up, not
08:31:17 - 08:31:19
one more sound.
08:31:19 - 08:31:21
Morning came, on the black
08:31:21 - 08:31:23
deep rests a bark, rests
08:31:23 - 08:31:25
on the swell. What has happened?
08:31:25 - 08:31:27
Hundreds keep asking that.
08:31:27 - 08:31:29
Who died? Who fell?
08:31:29 - 08:31:31
Nothing happened.
08:31:31 - 08:31:33
We found sleep, all of us,
08:31:33 - 08:31:35
we slept so well.
08:31:35 - 08:31:37
Declaration of love,
08:31:37 - 08:31:39
in the course of which the poet fell into a pit.
08:31:39 - 08:31:41
Wonder,
08:31:41 - 08:31:43
does he still fly?
08:31:43 - 08:31:45
He soars, and yet his wings are still?
08:31:45 - 08:31:47
What buoys him up
08:31:47 - 08:31:49
so high? What are his
08:31:49 - 08:31:51
goal, his way, his will?
08:31:51 - 08:31:53
Gleich Stern und
08:31:53 - 08:31:55
Ewigkeit lebt er in Höhen jetzt,
08:31:55 - 08:31:57
die das Leben flieht.
08:31:57 - 08:31:59
Mitleidig selbst dem Neid.
08:31:59 - 08:32:01
Und hoch flog, wer ihn
08:32:01 - 08:32:03
auch nur schweben sieht. O
08:32:03 - 08:32:05
Vogel Albatros, zur Höhe
08:32:05 - 08:32:07
treibt's mit ewigem Triebe mich.
08:32:07 - 08:32:09
Ich dachte dein.
08:32:09 - 08:32:11
Da floss mir Tränen um Träne.
08:32:11 - 08:32:13
Ja, ich liebe dich.
08:32:13 - 08:32:15
Lied eines theokritischen
08:32:15 - 08:32:17
Ziegenhirten.
08:32:17 - 08:32:19
Da lieg ich, krank im Gedärm,
08:32:19 - 08:32:21
mich fressen die Wanzen, und
08:32:21 - 08:32:23
drüben noch Licht und Lärm.
08:32:23 - 08:32:25
Ich hör's, sie tanzen.
08:32:25 - 08:32:27
Sie wollte um diese Stunde zu mir
08:32:27 - 08:32:29
reichen. Ich warte wie ein Hund.
08:32:29 - 08:32:31
Es kommt kein Zeichen.
08:32:31 - 08:32:33
Das Kreuz, als sie's versprach?
08:32:33 - 08:32:35
Wie konnte sie lügen?
08:32:35 - 08:32:37
Oder läuft sie jedem
08:32:37 - 08:32:39
nach wie meine Ziegen?
08:32:39 - 08:32:41
Woher ihr seid, Naroc?
08:32:41 - 08:32:43
Ah, meine Stolze!
08:32:43 - 08:32:45
Es wohnt noch mancher Bock an diesem Holze.
08:32:45 - 08:32:47
Wie kraus und giftig
08:32:47 - 08:32:49
macht Verliebtes warten.
08:32:49 - 08:32:51
Timeless now and starry,
08:32:51 - 08:32:53
he lives at heights that life seeks
08:32:53 - 08:32:55
to avoid. For envy he
08:32:55 - 08:32:57
feels sorry, and high soar
08:32:57 - 08:32:59
all who merely see him buoyed.
08:32:59 - 08:33:01
Oh, Albatross, I'm
08:33:01 - 08:33:03
swept up high by an eternal
08:33:03 - 08:33:05
impulse spurred. I thought of
08:33:05 - 08:33:07
you and wept tear upon tear.
08:33:07 - 08:33:09
I love you, noble bird.
08:33:09 - 08:33:11
Song of a theocritical
08:33:11 - 08:33:13
Goatherder. Here I lie
08:33:13 - 08:33:15
with intestinal blight, bedbugs
08:33:15 - 08:33:17
advancing, over there still
08:33:17 - 08:33:19
noise and light. I hear them
08:33:19 - 08:33:21
dancing. She promised.
08:33:21 - 08:33:23
She is late. She would be
08:33:23 - 08:33:25
mine. But like a dog I
08:33:25 - 08:33:27
wait, and there's no sign.
08:33:27 - 08:33:29
She swore again and
08:33:29 - 08:33:31
again. Was it by rote?
08:33:31 - 08:33:33
Does she run after all men
08:33:33 - 08:33:35
just like a goat? You give
08:33:35 - 08:33:37
yourself such airs. Who gave you silk?
08:33:37 - 08:33:39
How do I know who shares
08:33:39 - 08:33:41
your goat-like ilk?
08:33:41 - 08:33:43
We're poisoned by love when we wait.
08:33:43 - 08:33:45
It makes us barbaric.
08:33:45 - 08:33:47
So wächst bei schwüler Nacht Giftpilz
08:33:47 - 08:33:49
im Garten. Die Liebe zerrt
08:33:49 - 08:33:51
an mir gleich sieben Übeln.
08:33:51 - 08:33:53
Nichts mag ich essen, Schirr.
08:33:53 - 08:33:55
Lebt wohl, ihr Zwiebeln.
08:33:55 - 08:33:57
Der Mond ging schon ins Meer.
08:33:57 - 08:33:59
Müd sind alle Sterne. Grau
08:33:59 - 08:34:01
kommt der Tag daher. Ich
08:34:01 - 08:34:03
stürbe gerne.
08:34:03 - 08:34:05
Diesen ungewissen Seelen.
08:34:05 - 08:34:07
Diesen ungewissen
08:34:07 - 08:34:09
Seelen bin ich grimmig gram.
08:34:09 - 08:34:11
All ihr Ehren ist ein
08:34:11 - 08:34:13
Quälen. All ihr Lob ist
08:34:13 - 08:34:15
Selbstverdruss und Scham.
08:34:15 - 08:34:17
Dass ich nicht an ihrem Stricke
08:34:17 - 08:34:19
ziehe durch die Zeit, dafür
08:34:19 - 08:34:21
sind mich ihre Blicke giftig süßer,
08:34:21 - 08:34:23
hoffnungsloser Neid.
08:34:23 - 08:34:25
Möchten sie mir herzhaft fluchen und die
08:34:25 - 08:34:27
Nase drehen. Dieser Augen
08:34:27 - 08:34:29
hilflos suchen soll bei mir auf
08:34:29 - 08:34:31
ewig Irre gehen.
08:34:31 - 08:34:33
Narr in
08:34:33 - 08:34:35
Verzweiflung
08:34:35 - 08:34:37
Ach, was ich
08:34:37 - 08:34:39
schrieb auf Tisch und Wand mit
08:34:39 - 08:34:41
Narrenherz und Narrenhand,
08:34:41 - 08:34:43
das sollte Tisch und Wand mir zieren?
08:34:43 - 08:34:45
Two stamp nights generate
08:34:45 - 08:34:47
the fly agaric.
08:34:47 - 08:34:49
Love eats me like a blight.
08:34:49 - 08:34:51
It is the seventh hell.
08:34:51 - 08:34:53
I've lost my appetite.
08:34:53 - 08:34:55
Onions, farewell.
08:34:55 - 08:34:57
The moon set in the sea.
08:34:57 - 08:34:59
The stars fade in the sky.
08:34:59 - 08:35:01
The day is
08:35:01 - 08:35:03
dawning grey.
08:35:03 - 08:35:05
I'd like to die.
08:35:05 - 08:35:07
Souls that are unsure.
08:35:07 - 08:35:09
Souls that are unsure
08:35:09 - 08:35:11
and cloying I loathe like their acclaim.
08:35:11 - 08:35:13
All their honors are
08:35:13 - 08:35:15
annoying. All their praise is
08:35:15 - 08:35:17
self-hatred and shame.
08:35:17 - 08:35:19
Since I do not join their dances,
08:35:19 - 08:35:21
tied to their old rope,
08:35:21 - 08:35:23
I am followed by their glances.
08:35:23 - 08:35:25
Sweetly poisoned envy
08:35:25 - 08:35:27
without hope.
08:35:27 - 08:35:29
Let them curse me and despise
08:35:29 - 08:35:31
my way. Let them hiss.
08:35:31 - 08:35:33
When the seeking of these eyes
08:35:33 - 08:35:35
aims at me, it shall
08:35:35 - 08:35:37
forever miss. Fool
08:35:37 - 08:35:39
in despair.
08:35:39 - 08:35:41
All that I wrote on table and wall with
08:35:41 - 08:35:43
a foolish heart and foolish scrawl
08:35:43 - 08:35:45
was meant to add a little grace.
08:35:45 - 08:35:47
But you say, smear
08:35:47 - 08:35:49
fool's hands and
08:35:49 - 08:35:51
one shall purge table and wall
08:35:51 - 08:35:53
until the last trace disappears.
08:35:53 - 08:35:55
Allowed.
08:35:55 - 08:35:57
I lay my hand on it.
08:35:57 - 08:35:59
I learned to lead sponge and broom
08:35:59 - 08:36:01
as a critic, as a waterman.
08:36:01 - 08:36:03
But when the work is done,
08:36:03 - 08:36:05
I'd like to see you
08:36:05 - 08:36:07
hand it over with wisdom
08:36:07 - 08:36:09
table and wall bash.
08:36:09 - 08:36:11
Rimus remedium, or
08:36:11 - 08:36:13
Wie kranke Dichter
08:36:13 - 08:36:15
sich trösten.
08:36:17 - 08:36:19
Aus deinem Munde
08:36:19 - 08:36:21
du speichelflüssige Hexe
08:36:21 - 08:36:23
zeit. You say,
08:36:23 - 08:36:25
the hands of fools deface table
08:36:25 - 08:36:27
and wall. One must erase
08:36:27 - 08:36:29
all he has written. All.
08:36:29 - 08:36:31
I'd like to help as best
08:36:31 - 08:36:33
I can. I wield a sponge
08:36:33 - 08:36:35
as you recall, as critic
08:36:35 - 08:36:37
and as waterman. But when
08:36:37 - 08:36:39
the cleaning up is done, let's see
08:36:39 - 08:36:41
the super sage emit upon the walls
08:36:41 - 08:36:43
sagacious shit.
08:36:43 - 08:36:45
Rimus remedium,
08:36:45 - 08:36:47
how sick poets console
08:36:47 - 08:36:49
themselves.
08:36:49 - 08:36:51
From your
08:36:51 - 08:36:53
old lips, O time, you drooling
08:36:53 - 08:36:55
ghoul, tropft langsam
08:36:55 - 08:36:57
stund auf stunde, umsonst,
08:36:57 - 08:36:59
das all mein Ekel schreit,
08:36:59 - 08:37:01
Fluch, Fluch dem Schlünde der
08:37:01 - 08:37:03
Ewigkeit. Welt
08:37:03 - 08:37:05
ist von Erz, ein glühender
08:37:05 - 08:37:07
Stier, der hört kein Schrein.
08:37:07 - 08:37:09
Mit fliegenden Dolchen schreibt
08:37:09 - 08:37:11
der Schmerz mir ins Gebein.
08:37:11 - 08:37:13
Welt hat kein Herz, und
08:37:13 - 08:37:15
Dummheit wär's ihr Gram drum sein.
08:37:15 - 08:37:17
Gieß alle Mohne,
08:37:17 - 08:37:19
gieß, Fieber, gift
08:37:19 - 08:37:21
mir ins Gehirn. Zu lang
08:37:21 - 08:37:23
schon prüfst du mir Hand und Stirn.
08:37:23 - 08:37:25
Was fragst du? Was?
08:37:25 - 08:37:27
Zu welchem?
08:37:27 - 08:37:29
Lohne? Ha!
08:37:29 - 08:37:31
Fluch der Dirn und ihrem Hohne.
08:37:31 - 08:37:33
Nein, komm zurück.
08:37:33 - 08:37:35
Draußen ist's kalt, ich höre
08:37:35 - 08:37:37
Regnen. Ich sollte dir zärtlicher
08:37:37 - 08:37:39
begegnen? Nimm.
08:37:39 - 08:37:41
Hier ist Gold. Wie glänzt das
08:37:41 - 08:37:43
Stück? Dich heißen Glück,
08:37:43 - 08:37:45
Dich, Fieber, Segnen?
08:37:45 - 08:37:47
Die Tür springt auf.
08:37:47 - 08:37:49
Der Regen sprüht nach meinem
08:37:49 - 08:37:51
Bette. Wind löscht das Licht.
08:37:51 - 08:37:53
Unheil in Häuf. Wer jetzt
08:37:53 - 08:37:55
nicht hundert Reime hätte, ich wette, wette
08:37:55 - 08:37:57
der ginge drauf. Hauer
08:37:57 - 08:37:59
upon hauer drips.
08:37:59 - 08:38:01
My nausea cries to no avail.
08:38:01 - 08:38:03
Damn, damn
08:38:03 - 08:38:05
the grip of your eternal rule.
08:38:05 - 08:38:07
World, hard as stones,
08:38:07 - 08:38:09
a glowing bull, he hears
08:38:09 - 08:38:11
no crying. Pain writes
08:38:11 - 08:38:13
with daggers that are flying into my bones.
08:38:13 - 08:38:15
World has no heart.
08:38:15 - 08:38:17
The fool bears her a grudge and groans.
08:38:17 - 08:38:19
Poor poppies,
08:38:19 - 08:38:21
poor, oh fever, poison
08:38:21 - 08:38:23
in my brain. You
08:38:23 - 08:38:25
test my brow too long with pain.
08:38:25 - 08:38:27
Why do you ask? For what?
08:38:27 - 08:38:29
Reward. Ha!
08:38:29 - 08:38:31
Damn the whore and her
08:38:31 - 08:38:33
disdain. No, come back,
08:38:33 - 08:38:35
hold. I hear the rain
08:38:35 - 08:38:37
outside, it's cold. I should be gentler?
08:38:37 - 08:38:39
You want a caress?
08:38:39 - 08:38:41
Take this. It glistens.
08:38:41 - 08:38:43
It is gold. You
08:38:43 - 08:38:45
happiness? You fever I
08:38:45 - 08:38:47
should bless? A gust.
08:38:47 - 08:38:49
The door flies open. Rain.
08:38:49 - 08:38:51
My bed gets wet.
08:38:51 - 08:38:53
The light's blown out. Mishaps galore.
08:38:53 - 08:38:55
Without a hundred rhymes,
08:38:55 - 08:38:57
a white, I bet, I bet,
08:38:57 - 08:38:59
would be done for.
08:38:59 - 08:39:01
My happiness.
08:39:01 - 08:39:03
The poppies
08:39:03 - 08:39:05
of San Marco I see again.
08:39:05 - 08:39:07
The place is still.
08:39:07 - 08:39:09
Morning rest on it. In gentle
08:39:09 - 08:39:11
coolness I send mushy songs,
08:39:11 - 08:39:13
like swarming poppies, into the blue.
08:39:13 - 08:39:15
And lure them back,
08:39:15 - 08:39:17
to hang another rhyme into the feather.
08:39:17 - 08:39:19
My happiness. My happiness.
08:39:19 - 08:39:21
You still sky-roof,
08:39:21 - 08:39:23
blue light. From the side,
08:39:23 - 08:39:25
how do you hover over the colorful building
08:39:25 - 08:39:27
that I, what do I say?
08:39:27 - 08:39:29
Love. Fear.
08:39:29 - 08:39:31
Jealousy.
08:39:31 - 08:39:33
The soul I choose, I like to
08:39:33 - 08:39:35
drown it out. Do I ever
08:39:35 - 08:39:37
give it back? No,
08:39:37 - 08:39:39
be quiet, you eyes of wonder.
08:39:39 - 08:39:41
My happiness. My happiness.
08:39:41 - 08:39:43
You strict tower, with what lion's
08:39:43 - 08:39:45
urge do you rise up here?
08:39:45 - 08:39:47
Victorious, but tired. You
08:39:47 - 08:39:49
overshadow the place with a deep sound.
08:39:49 - 08:39:51
French. Would you be
08:39:51 - 08:39:53
his Ascent Aigu?
08:39:53 - 08:39:55
If I stayed with you, I would know
08:39:55 - 08:39:57
that I was forced.
08:39:57 - 08:39:59
My happiness. My happiness.
08:39:59 - 08:40:01
Go on, go on, music.
08:40:01 - 08:40:03
Let the shadows darken first, and grow
08:40:03 - 08:40:05
until the brown, blue night.
08:40:05 - 08:40:07
It is too early for the tone of the day.
08:40:07 - 08:40:09
The gold cirates still sparkle
08:40:09 - 08:40:11
not in rose splendor.
08:40:11 - 08:40:13
There is still a lot of day left.
08:40:13 - 08:40:15
A lot of day for the dense,
08:40:15 - 08:40:17
sneaking, lonely mumbling.
08:40:17 - 08:40:19
My happiness. My happiness.
08:40:19 - 08:40:21
My happiness.
08:40:21 - 08:40:23
The pigeons
08:40:23 - 08:40:25
of San Marco.
08:40:25 - 08:40:27
Discry again.
08:40:27 - 08:40:29
Calm is the square.
08:40:29 - 08:40:31
Still signs of dew.
08:40:31 - 08:40:33
It's mild and cool.
08:40:33 - 08:40:35
Like swarms of pigeons,
08:40:35 - 08:40:37
I send up my songs into the blue,
08:40:37 - 08:40:39
and idly lure them back to add
08:40:39 - 08:40:41
another rhyme before they fly.
08:40:41 - 08:40:43
My happiness.
08:40:43 - 08:40:45
My luck.
08:40:45 - 08:40:47
You light blue roof of heaven,
08:40:47 - 08:40:49
silky sheer, you float above
08:40:49 - 08:40:51
the colored edifice that I,
08:40:51 - 08:40:53
what am I saying? Envy,
08:40:53 - 08:40:55
love, and fear.
08:40:55 - 08:40:57
I'd like to drain its soul as in a
08:40:57 - 08:40:59
kiss. And would I give it
08:40:59 - 08:41:01
back? No more of that, you
08:41:01 - 08:41:03
sight of endless cheer. My happiness.
08:41:03 - 08:41:05
My luck. You severe
08:41:05 - 08:41:07
tower. With what lion's flare
08:41:07 - 08:41:09
did you rise without effort?
08:41:09 - 08:41:11
Gloriously. Sonorous sound
08:41:11 - 08:41:13
you send across the square.
08:41:13 - 08:41:15
In French, you would be its accent
08:41:15 - 08:41:17
aigu. If I,
08:41:17 - 08:41:19
like you, stayed back,
08:41:19 - 08:41:21
I would be caught in a soft, silken
08:41:21 - 08:41:23
snare. My happiness.
08:41:23 - 08:41:25
My luck. Be
08:41:25 - 08:41:27
gone, oh music. Give the
08:41:27 - 08:41:29
shadows time to grow into a brown
08:41:29 - 08:41:31
mild night and doze.
08:41:31 - 08:41:33
It is too early in the day to chime.
08:41:33 - 08:41:35
The golden ornaments have not
08:41:35 - 08:41:37
turned rose. The day is
08:41:37 - 08:41:39
holding back. Still time to
08:41:39 - 08:41:41
prowl, talk to oneself,
08:41:41 - 08:41:43
and rhyme. My
08:41:43 - 08:41:45
happiness. My luck.
08:41:45 - 08:41:47
Nach neuen Meeren.
08:41:47 - 08:41:49
Dort hin will ich.
08:41:49 - 08:41:51
Und ich traue mir
08:41:51 - 08:41:53
fort an und meinem Griff.
08:41:53 - 08:41:55
Offen liegt das Meer. Ins blaue
08:41:55 - 08:41:57
treibt mein genueser Schiff.
08:41:57 - 08:41:59
Alles glänzt mir neu und neuer.
08:41:59 - 08:42:01
Mittag schläft auf Raum und
08:42:01 - 08:42:03
Zeit. Nur dein Auge.
08:42:03 - 08:42:05
Ungeheuer blickt michs an.
08:42:05 - 08:42:07
Unendlichkeit.
08:42:07 - 08:42:09
Seels Maria.
08:42:09 - 08:42:11
Hier saß ich.
08:42:11 - 08:42:13
Wartend. Wartend.
08:42:13 - 08:42:15
Doch auf nichts, jenseits
08:42:15 - 08:42:17
von Gut und Böse, bald des
08:42:17 - 08:42:19
Lichts. Genießend.
08:42:19 - 08:42:21
Bald des Schattens. Ganz nur
08:42:21 - 08:42:23
Spiel. Ganz See.
08:42:23 - 08:42:25
Ganz Mittag. Ganz Zeit ohne
08:42:25 - 08:42:27
Ziel. Da plötzlich, Freundin,
08:42:27 - 08:42:29
wurde eins zu zwei
08:42:29 - 08:42:31
und Zaratustra ging an mir
08:42:31 - 08:42:33
vorbei. Toward new sea seven.
08:42:33 - 08:42:35
That way is my will.
08:42:35 - 08:42:37
I trust in my mind
08:42:37 - 08:42:39
and in my grip.
08:42:39 - 08:42:41
Without plan, into the vast
08:42:41 - 08:42:43
open sea I head my ship.
08:42:43 - 08:42:45
All is shining.
08:42:45 - 08:42:47
New and newer. Upon
08:42:47 - 08:42:49
space and time sleeps noon.
08:42:49 - 08:42:51
Only your eye. Monstrously.
08:42:51 - 08:42:53
Stares at me. Infinity.
08:42:53 - 08:42:55
Seels Maria.
08:42:55 - 08:42:57
Here I
08:42:57 - 08:42:59
sat. Waiting. Not for
08:42:59 - 08:43:01
anything beyond good and evil. Fancying.
08:43:01 - 08:43:03
Now light. Now shadows.
08:43:03 - 08:43:05
All a game. All lake.
08:43:05 - 08:43:07
All noon. All time without
08:43:07 - 08:43:09
all aim. Then suddenly,
08:43:09 - 08:43:11
friend, one turned into two
08:43:11 - 08:43:13
and Zaratustra walked into my
08:43:13 - 08:43:15
view.
08:43:15 - 08:43:17
And then Mistral ein Tanzlied.
08:43:17 - 08:43:19
Mistralwind,
08:43:19 - 08:43:21
du Wolkenjäger, Trübsalmörder,
08:43:21 - 08:43:23
Himmelsfäger, Brausender, wie lieb ich
08:43:23 - 08:43:25
dich? Sind wir zwei
08:43:25 - 08:43:27
nicht eines Schosses Erstlingsgabe,
08:43:27 - 08:43:29
eines Loses vorbestimmte Ewiglich?
08:43:29 - 08:43:31
Hier auf glatten
08:43:31 - 08:43:33
Felsenwegen lauf ich tanzend
08:43:33 - 08:43:35
dir entgegen, tanzend, wie du
08:43:35 - 08:43:37
pfeifst und singst, der du
08:43:37 - 08:43:39
ohne Schiff und Ruder als der Freiheit
08:43:39 - 08:43:41
reister Bruder über wilde Meere
08:43:41 - 08:43:43
springst. Kaum erwacht,
08:43:43 - 08:43:45
hörte ich dein Rufen, stürmte zu den
08:43:45 - 08:43:47
Felsenstufen, hin zur gelben Wand
08:43:47 - 08:43:49
am Meer. Heil!
08:43:49 - 08:43:51
Da kamst du schon gleich, hellen
08:43:51 - 08:43:53
Diamantenen Strom, es schnellen,
08:43:53 - 08:43:55
sieghaft von den Bergen her.
08:43:55 - 08:43:57
Auf den ebnen Himmelsstännen sah ich
08:43:57 - 08:43:59
deine Rosse rennen, sah den Wagen,
08:43:59 - 08:44:05
Sah die Hand dir selber zücken, wenn sie auf der Rosse Rücken blitzesgleich die Geißei
08:44:05 - 08:44:06
schlägt.
08:44:06 - 08:44:11
Sah dich aus dem Wagen springen, schneller dich hinabzuschwingen, sah dich wie zum Pfeil
08:44:11 - 08:44:17
verkürzt senkrecht in die Tiefe stoßen, wie ein Goldstrahl durch die Rosen erster Morgenröten
08:44:17 - 08:44:18
stürzt.
08:44:18 - 08:44:26
To the Mistral a Dancing Song Mistral Wind, you rain cloud leper, sadness
08:44:26 - 08:44:30
killer, heaven-sweeper, how I love you when you roar.
08:44:30 - 08:44:36
Were we too not generated in one womb, predestinated for one lot for evermore?
08:44:36 - 08:44:42
Here on slippery rocky traces I dance into your embraces, dancing as you sing and whistle,
08:44:42 - 08:44:49
you that, shipless, do not halt, freedom's freeze-brother, vault over ragging seas, a
08:44:49 - 08:44:50
missile.
08:44:50 - 08:44:55
Barely waked I heard your calling, stormed to where the rocks are sprawling to the gold
08:44:55 - 08:44:58
wall by the sea.
08:44:58 - 08:45:05
When you came like swiftly dashing river rapids, diamond-splashing, from the peaks triumphantly.
08:45:05 - 08:45:10
Through the heaven's threshing basin I could see your horses hasten, saw the carriage you
08:45:10 - 08:45:15
commanded, saw your hand yourself attack when upon the horse's back, lightning like your
08:45:15 - 08:45:17
scourge descended.
08:45:17 - 08:45:22
From your carriage of disaster leaping to bear down yet faster, I saw you in arrow form
08:45:22 - 08:45:29
vertically downward plunging, like a golden sunbeam lunging through the roses of the dawn.
08:45:29 - 08:45:35
Tanze nun auf tausend Rücken, Wellenrücken, Wellentücken, heil, wer neue Tanze schafft,
08:45:35 - 08:45:42
tanzen wir in tausend Weisen, frei, sei unsere Kunst geheißen, fröhlich, unsere Wissenschaft.
08:45:42 - 08:45:48
Raffen wir von jeder Blume eine Blüte uns zum Rume und zwei Blätter noch zum Kranz,
08:45:48 - 08:45:53
tanzen wir gleich Troubadouren zwischen Heiligen und Huren, zwischen Gott und Welt den Tanz.
08:45:53 - 08:46:00
Wer nicht tanzen kann mit Winden, wir sich wickeln, muss mit Binden, angebunden, Krüppelgreis,
08:46:00 - 08:46:07
wer da gleich den Heuchel hänsen, Ehrentölpeln, Tugend gänsen, fort aus unserem Paradeis.
08:46:07 - 08:46:12
Wirbeln wir den Staub der Straßen allen Kranken in die Nasen, scheuchen wir die Krankenbrut.
08:46:12 - 08:46:18
Lösen wir die ganze Küste von dem Odem dürrer Brüste, von den Augen ohne Mut.
08:46:18 - 08:46:23
Jagen wir die Himmels trüber, Weltenschwärzer, Wolkenschieber.
08:46:23 - 08:46:28
Hellen wir das Himmelreich, brausen wir, o allerfreien Geistergeist,
08:46:28 - 08:46:33
mit dir zu zweien braust mein Glück dem Sturme gleich.
08:46:33 - 08:46:39
Und das ewig das Gedächtnis solchen Glücks, nimm sein Vermächtnis, nimm den Kranz hier mit hinauf,
08:46:39 - 08:46:46
wirf ihn höher, ferner, weiter, stürm empor die Himmelsleiter, häng ihn an den Sternen auf.
08:46:46 - 08:46:53
Dance on myriad backs a season, billows backs and billows treason, we need dances that are new.
08:46:53 - 08:47:00
Let us dance in myriad manners, freedom right on our arts' banners, our science shall be gay.
08:47:00 - 08:47:06
Let us break from every flower one fine blossom for our power, and two leaves to wind a wreath.
08:47:06 - 08:47:12
Let us dance like troubadours between holy men and whores, between God and world beneath.
08:47:12 - 08:47:19
Who thinks tempests dance too quickly, all the bandaged and the sickly, crippled old and overnice,
08:47:19 - 08:47:26
if you fear the wind might hurt you, honor fools and geese of virtue, out of our paradise.
08:47:26 - 08:47:32
Let us whirl the dusty hazes right into the sick men's noses, flush the sick brood everywhere.
08:47:32 - 08:47:37
Let us free the coast together from the wilted bosom's blether, from the eyes that never dare.
08:47:37 - 08:47:42
Let us chase the shadow lovers, world defamers, raincloud shovers.
08:47:42 - 08:47:48
Let us brighten up the sky, all free spirit's spirit, let you and me thunder,
08:47:48 - 08:47:51
since I met you like a tempest roars my joy.
08:47:51 - 08:47:58
And forever to attest such great joy, take its bequest, take this wreath with you up there,
08:47:58 - 08:48:05
toss it higher, further, gladder, storm up on the heaven's ladder, hang it up upon a star.
